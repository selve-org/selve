# LaHaye Writing Patterns - Extraction for SELVE Templates

**Purpose:** Extract psychological narrative patterns from Tim LaHaye's temperament descriptions to write confrontational, specific, behavioral-prediction-based personality templates.

**Core Principle:** LaHaye doesn't say "you might be social" - he says "you enter a room mouth first" and "no one can love you more nor forget you faster."

---

## Pattern 1: SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL PREDICTIONS

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine (High LUMEN):**

- "A sanguine always enters a room mouth first"
- "He fixes his eyes with equal intensity on the next person he meets"
- "If yesterday's project failed, he is confident today's will succeed"
- "He can't even remember where he put the contracts, much less fill them out"
- "You may be on the verge of death, as white as the sheet you are lying on when he bubbles into the room, but before he leaves, he will lift your spirits"

**Choleric (High KAEL):**

- "A choleric can't resist the temptation to throw in extra goodies to his customers and make extra promises"
- "He is a door slammer, table pounder, and horn blower"
- "When Rocky drives through the countryside, he cannot share his wife's enjoyment of the 'beautiful rolling hillsides,' for he envisions road graders carving out streets"
- "He usually stops crying at the age of eleven or twelve"

**Melancholy (High ORIN):**

- "They can ask more questions about your product than both the inventor and manufacturer ever thought of"
- "Your calendar is color-coded and you get physically anxious when someone moves your labeled bins" (implied from perfectionism)
- "Instead of commending their wives and encouraging them, melancholies criticize, carp, and censure"

**Phlegmatic (High SERA/EIRENE):**

- "They smile as I detail the program, even nod their head as if they understand, and then walk away and ignore the mandate"
- "He will somehow manage to sidestep the demand"
- "They just drag their feet or set their legs and will not budge"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You are organized"
Write: "Your desk has color-coded folders. When someone borrows your pen without asking, you mentally track it. You've remade your bed because the corner wasn't hospital-tight."

Instead of: "You are social"
Write: "You've never met a silence you couldn't fill. Three seconds of quiet in a conversation and you're already telling the plant story again. People know you're coming before they see you."

Instead of: "You avoid conflict"
Write: "You'll smile and nod through the entire meeting, agree to everything, then simply do it your way afterward. You'd rather rearrange your entire schedule than tell someone 'no' directly."
```

---

## Pattern 2: UNCOMFORTABLE EXPOSURE (Naming What They Hide)

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "No one can love you more nor forget you faster"
- "He fixes his eyes with equal intensity on the NEXT person he meets" (exposes superficiality)
- "He cons himself into believing that 'the end justifies the means'"
- "His obvious compassion in response to your tale of woe will almost make paying his exorbitant bill easy"

**Choleric:**

- "He tends to be domineering and bossy and does not hesitate to use people to accomplish his ends"
- "He is often considered an opportunist"
- "The choleric can cause pain to others and enjoy it"
- "He has the hide of a rhinoceros"

**Melancholy:**

- "He dissects himself with a continuing barrage of introspection until he has no self-confidence left"
- "Everything in life is interpreted by the melancholy in relation to himself"
- "The minute a new idea or project is presented, his analytical ability ignites and he begins to concoct every problem and difficulty"

**Phlegmatic:**

- "Beneath the gracious surface of a diplomatic phlegmatic beats a very fearful heart"
- "No one can be more stubborn than a phlegmatic, but he is so diplomatic about it that he may proceed halfway through life before others catch on"
- "Beneath the gracious surface... beats a very fearful heart"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You care about people"
Write: "You'll weep at their tragedy during lunch, then forget their name by dinner. Your compassion is real in the moment and gone by the next person who needs you. You make people feel like they're your best friend - until you meet the next one."

Instead of: "You are confident"
Write: "You'll walk over people to get what you want and sleep soundly that night. You've made grown men cry in meetings and told yourself they needed tougher skin. When people call you 'difficult,' you hear 'effective.'"

Instead of: "You are agreeable"
Write: "Everyone thinks you're so easy-going. They don't know you've been seething about that comment from Tuesday for six days straight. You won't confront anyone, but you'll mentally replay the argument you wish you'd had forty-seven times."
```

---

## Pattern 3: PREDICTIVE SCENARIOS (If X, Then Y)

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "If yesterday's project failed, he is confident today's will succeed"
- "If he catches another person looking at him, he always responds with a nod, wink, or greeting"
- "Any person or thing that gets in his way, retards his progress... will feel the eruption of his wrath" (Choleric)

**Choleric:**

- "Just about the time his optimism has come home to engulf him in impossibility, he doggedly burrows out another way"
- "If he doesn't become too arrogant or bossy, others respond well to his practical direction"
- "When once given the responsibility, he has a real ability to get people to work together"

**Melancholy:**

- "The more the choleric tries to motivate the phlegmatic, the more the phlegmatic digs in his heels and stubbornly refuses to move"
- "Even when the children bring home B's and B-pluses, the parent will grimace with dissatisfaction because they don't get A's"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You handle stress differently"
Write: "When stressed: The extrovert books three social events for tonight. The introvert ghosts everyone for a week. You can predict your spiral before it happens but you'll do it anyway."

Instead of: "You approach problems analytically"
Write: "Someone proposes an idea in a meeting. Before they finish the second sentence, you've already cataloged seventeen reasons it won't work. You call it 'realistic thinking.' They call it 'soul-crushing.'"

Instead of: "You're persistent"
Write: "When a door closes, you don't knock politely. You find the window, the back entrance, the ventilation shaft. If that doesn't work, you'll build a new door. Failure isn't in your vocabulary - just 'temporary setbacks.'"
```

---

## Pattern 4: PARADOX & CONTRADICTION REVEAL

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "Behind that super-extroverted personality... Sparky Sanguine is really quite insecure"
- "His noisy, blustering, friendly ways make him appear more confident than he really is"
- "Sparky will never become a perfectionist, but the Spirit of God can bring more planning and order into his life"

**Melancholy:**

- "The admirable qualities of perfectionism and conscientiousness often carry with them... negativism, pessimism, and a spirit of criticism"
- "He is ever examining his spiritual life and typically coming up short in his own mind"
- "Although not as expressive of his anger as the sanguine or choleric, he is very capable of long-term seething"

**Phlegmatic:**

- "One of the less obvious weaknesses of the phlegmatic is his selfishness... though he is so gracious and proper that few people who don't live with him are aware of it"
- "He almost never openly confronts another person or refuses to do something, but he will somehow manage to sidestep the demand"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You seem confident but have insecurities"
Write: "You're the loudest person in the room and the most terrified someone will discover you're faking it. Your confidence is volume control, not conviction."

Instead of: "You care about others but can be harsh"
Write: "You'll donate to charity and criticize your wife for buying the wrong brand of milk in the same hour. Your standards for humanity are noble; your standards for the humans you live with are impossible."

Instead of: "You avoid conflict but hold grudges"
Write: "You haven't argued with anyone in five years. You've also mentally written off seven people, replayed forty-three conversations, and emotionally divorced your brother-in-law. You're not avoiding conflict - you're stockpiling it."
```

## Pattern 5: PHYSICAL & ENVIRONMENTAL TELLS

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "His garage, bedroom, closet, and office are disaster areas"
- "He is a door slammer, table pounder, and horn blower" (Choleric)
- "They will often be found whistling or singing his way through life"

**Melancholy:**

- "Your calendar is color-coded and you get physically anxious when someone moves your labeled bins" (implied)
- "He works around the clock to meet deadlines... going without sleep, food, and diversion"

**Phlegmatic:**

- "He will smile as I detail the program, even nod his head as if he understands"
- "They just drag their feet or set their legs and will not budge"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You're organized"
Write: "Your spices are alphabetized. Your closet color-coded. Your daily routine timed to the minute. Someone moved your stapler two inches to the left and you felt it like a paper cut."

Instead of: "You're relaxed"
Write: "Your blood pressure is so low doctors check twice. Your resting heart rate suggests hibernation. People think you're calm - you're just conserving energy for things that actually matter."

Instead of: "You're energetic"
Write: "You walk into a room like a golden retriever in a dog park. People three cubicles away can hear you coming. Standing still feels like drowning."
```

## Pattern 6: RELATIONSHIP IMPACT (How Others Experience You)

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "One of the greatest assets of Mr. Sanguine is that he has a tender, compassionate heart"
- "No one can love you more nor forget you faster"
- "He can genuinely feel the joys and sorrows of the person he meets and has the capacity to make him feel important"

**Choleric:**

- "His wife is usually afraid of him, and he tends to terrify his children"
- "He leaves a path of damaged psyches and fractured egos wherever he goes"
- "Rarely does he either live up to his full capabilities or fail in life" (Phlegmatic)

**Melancholy:**

- "The world has benefited greatly from the gracious nature of Phil Phlegmatic"
- "His reticence to put himself forward is often taken as an indication that he doesn't enjoy people"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You're fun to be around"
Write: "People love you at parties and avoid you for deep conversations. You're the friend they call for celebration, not crisis. They know you care - they just don't expect you to remember their birthday."

Instead of: "You're dependable"
Write: "Your family calls you first in emergencies. Your friends call you... eventually. You're everyone's rock and no one's first choice for karaoke. Being reliable is your gift and your curse."

Instead of: "You're a strong leader"
Write: "Your team produces results and updates their resumes simultaneously. They respect your vision and fear your feedback. You get promoted; they get therapy."
```

## Pattern 7: VOCATIONAL TELLS (Career Behavior)

### Examples from LaHaye:

**Sanguine:**

- "Sparky is so convincing that he could sell rubber crutches to people who aren't even crippled"
- "Most sanguines can't even remember where they put the contracts, much less fill them out"
- "Most sanguines lament, 'Paperwork is the bane of my life'"

**Choleric:**

- "There are two reasons for this [boredom with successful business]... First as the business grows... it creates more detail work"
- "The average choleric can be expected to start four to ten businesses or organizations in a lifetime"
- "He'd rather get a number of things finished 70 to 80 percent than a few things 100 percent"

**Melancholy:**

- "His standard of excellence exceeds others' and his requirements of acceptability... are often higher than either he or anyone else can maintain"
- "Don't try to bluff them! If you don't know your product, don't even bother to call on them"

**Phlegmatic:**

- "Who but a phlegmatic could have the patience necessary to teach a group of first-graders to read?"
- "Phlegmatics often stay with one company for their entire working career"

### **Pattern Template:**

```
Instead of: "You excel in sales"
Write: "You've sold ice to Eskimos and convinced them they got a deal. Your pipeline is full. Your expense reports are fiction. Your manager loves and fears you in equal measure."

Instead of: "You're detail-oriented"
Write: "You'll spot the typo on page 47 that three editors missed. You'll also spend four hours on a task that needed thirty minutes because 'good enough' isn't in your vocabulary. Your work is flawless. Your deadlines are suggestions."

Instead of: "You prefer stable employment"
Write: "You've been at the same company for fourteen years. Same desk. Same lunch spot. Same 8:47am arrival time. You have four weeks of vacation saved up. Change is what happens to other people."
```

## WRITING RULES FOR SELVE TEMPLATES

### DO:

1. **Be brutally specific** - "You've rewritten the same email six times" not "You care about communication"
2. **Predict behavior** - "When stressed, you'll..." not "You might feel stressed"
3. **Expose hidden patterns** - Name what they do but won't admit
4. **Use physical details** - What does their desk look like? How do they walk into rooms?
5. **Show relationship impact** - How do others experience them?
6. **Include contradictions** - The persona vs. the reality
7. **Make it uncomfortably accurate** - They should think "How did they know?!"

### DON'T:

1. **No religious references** - Remove scripture, apostles, faith, sin language
2. **No generic statements** - "You're a good person" means nothing
3. **No maybes** - Be definitive. They DO this, not "might"
4. **No positivity bias** - Include the shadows, the uncomfortable truths
5. **No therapeutic language** - This isn't counseling, it's revelation
6. **No abstractions** - Make it tangible, observable, specific

### TONE:

- **Confrontational but not cruel** - Like a truth-telling friend, not an enemy
- **Knowing** - You've seen this before. You understand completely.
- **Specific** - Every sentence should feel personally targeted
- **Predictive** - You're telling them what they'll do next
- **Paradox-aware** - You see the contradiction they hide

---

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE (Generic):

"You are highly organized and detail-oriented. You prefer structure and planning. You can be perfectionistic at times."

### AFTER (LaHaye Style):

"Your closet is organized by season, then color, then frequency of use. You've woken up at 3am three times this month because you remembered a typo in an email. When someone says 'good enough,' you hear 'mediocre trash.' You'll spend an hour creating the perfect to-do list and feel accomplished before doing a single task on it. Your standards aren't high - they're unreachable. You know this. You'll criticize yourself for it tonight while lying in bed, then wake up tomorrow and do it all again."
