You're an emotional tuning fork, constantly vibrating with everyone else's frequency. It's exhausting and you can't turn it off.",

You can't see suffering without feeling it viscerally. You're the friend everyone calls in crisis because you GET it. You don't just sympathize - you feel their pain as if it's yours. Because in that moment, it is.",

Beautiful because you provide unmatched emotional support. Terrible because you can't ever turn it off. When they're stressed, you're stressed. When they're hurt, you're devastated. You carry their emotional weight on top of your own. You need a partner who understands you're not just supportive - you're absorbing their emotions and it's literally draining you.",

Your empathy is sustainable.",

    description="You can be incredibly empathetic or completely detached depending on the situation and person. Best friend crying? You're there, fully present, feeling with them. Random coworker complaining? You're nodding but internally thinking about lunch. You have empathy - you just don't distribute it equally. This makes you practical but sometimes makes you seem inconsistent or even callous.",

This frustrates them. They want you to care about everything they care about. You can't - and you won't pretend. You're selective, not unlimited. They need to understand: your empathy for THEM is deep. Your empathy for everyone adjacent to them is... negotiable.",
    at_work="You're empathetic with your immediate team, less so with other departments. You support coworkers you like, you're professionally cordial with everyone else. You're not winning awards for emotional intelligence across the organization. You're fine with that. You save your emotional energy for work that matters and people you respect. This makes you effective with your team but possibly seen as distant or political by others.",
    under_stress="Your empathy shrinks to just your core people. Everyone else gets minimal engagement. You don't have capacity to care about tangential problems. You feel guilty about this, but not guilty enough to force it. You know yourself: when depleted, you focus on what matters most. Everyone else will have to wait or find support elsewhere.",
    at_best="You've made peace with your selectivity. You're deeply empathetic with people you love and professionally appropriate with everyone else. You don't apologize for having limited emotional bandwidth. You invest it wisely. Your close relationships are rich and genuine. Your broader relationships are cordial but boundaried. You're not everyone's emotional support - and you're okay with that.",
    growth_path="Stop feeling guilty for not caring about everything equally. No one actually does - they just perform better than you. Own your selectivity: 'I care deeply about my people, less so about strangers.' That's normal. The growth is ensuring your selectivity isn't cruelty in disguise. Check: Am I protecting my energy or avoiding uncomfortable empathy? Sometimes we should care even when it's hard. Find that balance."

You're not heartless - you're just emotionally analytical in a world that wants you to just feel.",
    description="When someone's crying, your first thought is 'Why?' followed by 'How do we fix this?' You don't automatically feel with them. You think through their situation. You're the friend who offers solutions when they wanted empathy. You're confused when they get mad at your logical advice. You said the right thing - but apparently you should have just listened? This doesn't make sense to you. Emotions don't make sense to you.",
    inner_world="You think: 'What's the logical response here?' You don't have gut-level emotional understanding. You have to intellectually figure out what someone needs. You've learned scripts: crying person = offer tissue, say 'I'm sorry,' don't problem-solve immediately. It works sometimes. Other times you still miss the mark. You're trying, but empathy doesn't come naturally. It's a skill you've had to learn, not an instinct you have.",

If there's a problem, why wouldn't you want to fix it? They're frustrated. You're confused. You love them but you can't seem to give them what they need emotionally. You show love through actions - fixing things, handling logistics, being reliable. They want emotional connection. You're speaking different languages and both getting exhausted trying to translate.",
    at_work="You're great in logic-focused roles: engineering, finance, IT, research, analysis. You're terrible in people-focused roles. You don't do well in customer service, counseling, HR, teaching - anywhere emotional intelligence is required. You've been told you need to work on your 'soft skills.' You're trying. It's hard. You don't naturally read emotional rooms or understand unspoken needs. You're competent at your job; you're just not warm about it.",
    under_stress="You become even more logical and even less emotional. Others see this as cold. You see it as efficient. Emotions feel messy and overwhelming when stressed. You retreat to logic and facts. This alienates people who need emotional support during hard times. You can't give what you don't have. Your stress response is analysis, not empathy. They're hurt. You're bewildered. You're doing your best - it's just not what they need.",
    at_best="You've found work that values logic over emotion. You've found people who appreciate your practical support style. You've learned some empathy scripts that work most of the time. You've accepted you're not naturally empathetic and stopped beating yourself up about it. You contribute in other ways - reliability, problem-solving, loyalty. You're not everyone's emotional support, but you're someone's rock. That's enough.",
    growth_path="Stop trying to be someone you're not. You don't need to become highly empathetic. You need to learn minimum viable empathy: when to say 'that sounds hard' instead of 'here's how to fix it.' Study emotion like you'd study anything else - learn the patterns. Practice active listening. And be honest: 'I'm not good at emotional support, but I'm here and I care.' Often that honesty connects more than performed empathy ever would."

Emotions are abstract concepts you understand intellectually but don't experience interpersonally.",
    description="When someone tells you they're upset, you register it as information, not as a feeling. You can see they're crying but you don't feel moved by it. You know sadness exists - you've felt it yourself - but you don't feel sad because someone else is sad. This confuses people. They think you don't care. You do care - intellectually. You want to help - practically. You just don't feel the emotional connection others describe. You're not sure you ever have.",
    inner_world="You think: 'I should feel something here, right?' You're aware that most people have automatic emotional responses you don't have. You've studied emotions like anthropology - observing a culture you're not part of. You can identify that someone's upset. You can't feel upset with them.

You don't know how to give that. You're not withholding it - you don't have it to give. This might be insurmountable. They need emotional connection. You're offering logical partnership. Neither is wrong - they're just incompatible.",

You don't bond with your team emotionally. You're competent, not warm. Management roles are difficult unless they're purely strategic. You can't motivate through inspiration - only through logic and consequences. Some respect this. Others find you cold or intimidating. You don't understand the distinction.",

You've found the few people who accept you as you are. You've stopped pretending to feel things you don't. You contribute through action, logic, competence - not emotional support. You've accepted you're wired differently. You're not broken. You're just not empathetic. That's okay - not everyone needs to be.",
    growth_path="This isn't about developing empathy - you probably won't. This is about learning to function in a world that values emotional connection. Learn the scripts. Ask explicitly: 'Do you want advice or do you want me to listen?' Be honest: 'I'm not good at emotional support.' Find a partner who values stability over emotional intimacy - they exist. And consider: is this truly lack of empathy or is it alexithymia (inability to identify/express emotions)? Either way, find professionals and communities that understand your neurotype. You're not a monster. You're just emotionally different."
