Even when honesty hurts people. You're radically authentic, brutally honest, pathologically transparent. This is your superpower and your social liability.",
    description="You're the person who gives honest feedback when everyone else stays silent. You tell your friend their partner is wrong for them. You tell your boss their idea won't work. You correct people's mistakes even when it's awkward. You cannot pretend, cannot fake enthusiasm, cannot perform interest you don't feel. Your face shows everything. You're incapable of social deception. This makes you trustworthy and sometimes insufferable.",
    inner_world="You think: 'Why are we all pretending?' Social white lies confuse you. Why say the dinner was good if it wasn't? Why pretend to like someone you don't? You're bewildered by social performances everyone else seems to navigate effortlessly. You see lying everywhere - in politeness, in networking, in social niceties - and you can't participate. Your internal compass points to truth, always, regardless of consequences.",

There's no mystery, no social lubricant, no kind deception. You think this is intimacy. They sometimes think it's cruelty. You've hurt them with honesty more times than you can count. You won't change. You CAN'T lie, even to spare feelings. They either love your authenticity or they're exhausted by it. Often both.",

You can't network because you can't fake interest or charm. You won't laugh at the boss's bad joke. You won't pretend the project is going well when it's failing. This limits your career - you can't play politics. But people trust you absolutely. When you say something, they know it's true.",

You'd rather be alone and honest than connected and compromised.",

You've found people who value your authenticity without being destroyed by your bluntness.

You're still pathologically honest, but you've learned to deliver truth with compassion. People trust you and aren't afraid of you. That's growth.",

Practice this: 'Is this true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?' If you can't hit all three, reconsider. Your integrity is your strength - don't let it become your excuse to hurt people. Radical honesty without compassion is just aggression wearing a virtue costume."

You tell your friend their project is interesting even when it's not. You laugh at your boss's joke. You say you're busy instead of saying you don't want to go.

You keep some thoughts to yourself. You're not lying exactly - you're just... managing. This works until it doesn't. Until they realize you've been strategically honest and they question if they really know you. The challenge: where's the line between kindness and deception? You're not always sure yourself.",

This serves your career well. Sometimes you wonder if you've lost something authentic along the way.",

This isn't hypocrisy - it's social intelligence. You've stopped feeling guilty about it.",

If you're performing everywhere, even with loved ones, that's not strategy - that's loss of self. Find your authentic core and protect it. Be selective about when you perform, not performative about everything. And when you lie to yourself about lying, that's when you're in trouble."

You're whoever you need to be in the moment. You're charming because you're performing charm. You agree with people you privately disagree with. You fake enthusiasm, interest, care. It works - people like you. They also don't really know you.",

You network brilliantly because you can be whoever the situation needs. You're promoted because you're likeable and strategic. Your colleagues trust you just enough but something feels off. You're slippery. Hard to pin down. This serves you until someone catches you in a contradiction. Then your whole house of cards wobbles.",

You're slowly building genuine relationships instead of performed ones. You've realized that charm without authenticity is empty. You're tired of performing. You're trying to find your real self under all the social strategizing. It's hard. You've been performing so long, authenticity feels foreign. But you're trying.",
    growth_path="This is addiction to control. You lie to manage how people perceive you. Start small: tell one uncomfortable truth daily. Stop exaggerating stories. Catch yourself performing and drop it. Find one person you can be genuinely real with - therapist, friend, someone. Practice authenticity like a skill. And face this: you're lonely. All your connections are performances. No one knows you because you won't let them. Vulnerability is terrifying. Do it anyway. Real connection requires real you. Stop hiding."

You're in therapy, possibly court-mandated. You're starting to understand that your manipulation is trauma response, not strength. You're beginning the long road to authenticity.

You need intensive therapy, possibly medication, definitely accountability. Your deception destroys lives - yours included. You're profoundly alone behind all your masks. Authenticity terrifies you because you've never been vulnerable without being hurt. Start there: find one safe person to practice honesty with. Rebuild from ground up. This is possible but it requires admitting you need help. Can you do that honestly?"
