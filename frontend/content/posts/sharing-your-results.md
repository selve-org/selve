## Why Share Your Results?

So you've just completed your SELVE assessment and got your personality profile—awesome! Now you might want to share it with friends, family, or even that curious coworker who's been asking what you're all about.

Maybe you want to:
- Show your partner why you need alone time to recharge (hello, low LUMEN friends!)
- Help your team understand how you work best
- Compare profiles with friends and laugh about how accurate it is
- Start deeper conversations about what makes you *you*

Whatever your reason, we've made sharing super easy—and more importantly, you stay in complete control.

## How to Share Your Results

### Step 1: Find the Share Button

After you finish your assessment, you'll land on your results page. Look for the **"Share"** button in the top right corner—it has a little share icon (looks like connected dots).

### Step 2: Create Your Shareable Link

Click that share button and you'll see a menu pop up. Click **"Create Shareable Link"** and boom—we instantly generate a unique link just for you.

The link looks something like: `selve.me/share/abc123xyz`

### Step 3: Copy and Send

Hit **"Copy Link"** and you're done! You can now paste it anywhere:
- Text it to friends
- Share it in group chats
- Post it on social media (if you're feeling bold!)
- Email it to your therapist (they'll love this)

## Your Privacy Matters

Here's the thing: we know sharing personality stuff can feel vulnerable. That's why we built in some privacy features:

### What People CAN See:
- Your dimension scores (LUMEN, VARA, CHRONOS, etc.)
- Your personality narrative (the story about your profile)
- Your core identity traits
- General demographics (age range, that kind of thing)

### What People CANNOT See:
- Your email address
- Your exact location
- Your individual question answers
- Any identifying personal information

Think of it like showing someone your personality "highlight reel" without giving them access to your entire profile.

## Making Your Results Private Again

Changed your mind? No problem. Here's how to take your results offline:

1. Go back to your results page
2. Click the **Share** button again
3. Hit **"Make Private"**

Done! Your old link stops working immediately. Anyone who tries to visit it will just see a "not found" message.

### What Happens to the Old Link?

When you make your results private, we don't just hide them—we actually **delete the share link completely**. That means:

- The old link is permanently dead (no one can access it anymore)
- If you share again later, you get a **brand new link**
- You can't accidentally "resurrect" old links

This is by design. We figured you'd want a fresh start each time you decide to share, rather than worrying about old links floating around.

## Pro Tips for Sharing

### Tip #1: Share with Context
Instead of just dropping a link in the chat, try something like:
> "Hey, I just took this personality assessment and it's scary accurate. Check out my results—I'm apparently super high in VARA (self-control) but low in CHRONOS (emotional reactivity). Makes so much sense!"

People are way more likely to actually look at it if you give them a reason to care.

### Tip #2: Compare with Friends
This is where it gets fun. Get your friends to take the assessment too, then compare your profiles. You'll discover:
- Why you clash on certain things
- Why you click so well in other areas
- Hidden strengths you can lean on each other for

We've seen friend groups spend hours discussing their dimensions—it's like Myers-Briggs but actually backed by science.

### Tip #3: Use It for Team Building
If you're in a work setting, sharing results can be incredibly valuable:
- Managers learn how to motivate different team members
- Teams understand communication preferences
- Everyone gets insights into working styles

Just make sure everyone's comfortable sharing first—don't pressure anyone!

### Tip #4: Update Your Friends When You Retake
You can retake the SELVE assessment anytime (we recommend every 6-12 months). When you do, you'll get fresh results. If you shared your old results, you might want to share the new ones too so friends see your updated profile.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can people see my answers to individual questions?**  
Nope! They only see your final dimension scores and narrative. Your raw responses stay private.

**Q: Will the link expire after a certain time?**  
Not unless you make it private. Once shared, the link works forever (or until you revoke it).

**Q: Can I share different results with different people?**  
Each share link shows your current results. If you want to show different results to different people, you'd need to take the assessment multiple times (which... actually might be interesting for seeing how you change over time!).

**Q: What if I shared my results but then got a better score?**  
There's no "better" score in personality assessments! But if you retake the test and want to share updated results, just make the old link private and create a new one with your fresh scores.

**Q: Can people leave comments on my shared results?**  
Not yet, but that's a cool idea we're thinking about! For now, they'll have to text you their thoughts the old-fashioned way.

**Q: Is sharing anonymous?**  
Not at the moment, but it’s in the works! 🙂

## The Technical Stuff (For the Curious)

For those who want to know what's happening under the hood:

When you create a shareable link, we:
1. Generate a random, cryptographically secure ID (it's basically impossible to guess)
2. Mark your results as "public" in our database
3. Create a special URL that only shows your scores and narrative (not your personal info)

When you make it private, we:
1. Mark your results as "not public"
2. Delete the share ID completely
3. Any future visits to that link get a 404 error

Your data stays secure either way—we just change who can see your personality profile.

## Final Thoughts

Sharing your SELVE results should feel empowering, not scary. You control:
- **When** to share (or not share at all)
- **Who** gets the link
- **How long** it stays public

Think of it like posting on social media—except you have an actual delete button that works.

So go ahead, share those results! Start conversations about what makes you unique. Help people understand you better. And if you change your mind? Just hit "Make Private" and it's like it never happened.

Your personality is yours to share (or not)—we're just here to make it easy.

**Ready to share your results?** Head to your results page (accessible from your profile or after completing the assessment) and look for that share button in the top right corner. ✨
