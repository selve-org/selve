When I was in high school, there was a pair of identical twins
in my class. We could hardly tell them apart They tested out
identically on their IQ scores (128). But that is where the
similarities stopped. One was personable; the other withdrew
frompeople. One loved sports, history, and literature; the other
preferred math, physics, and language. Interesting to me was
the fact that their grade-point averages were almost identical at
the end of their four years in high school. Yet they did not get
the same grades in most subjects. What made the difference
between these young men? Their temperaments!
Temperament influences everything you do—from sleep
habits to study habits to eating style to the way you get along
with other people. Humanly speaking, there is no other
influence in your life more powerful than your temperament or
combination of temperaments. That is why it is so essential to
know your temperament and to be able to analyze other
people’s temperaments, not to condemn them, but so you can
maximize your potential and enable themto maximize theirs.
Sit with me in the counseling room and you will see what I
mean. The sanguine talks about the weather, friends, and a
hundred things before facing the real problem. The choleric
gets right to the point He (or she) wants you to straighten out
his partner so he can have a good home life. The melancholy
sighs deeply as he sits down with depression, self-pity, and
unhappiness etched on his face. The phlegmatic rarely gets
around to making an appointment, and when she does it takes
most of the first half hour just to prime her conversational
pump.
These people are not the temperament they are because they
do these things. Rather, they act the way they do because of
their temperaments. Some of our acts are subtle, like tastes or
preferences, while others involve outlooks and attitudes or
even styles of thinking. There is hardly a function in life that is
not influenced by temperament Thus, you had better determine
your temperament and consistently direct it into the best lifestyle for you and your family. Otherwise your temperament will
subconsciously direct you.
TEMPERAMENT AND EATING
HABITS
I can almost judge a man’s temperament by his eating habits.
Sanguines eat everything in sight—and usually look it In a
restaurant they so enjoy talking that they almost never look at
a menu until the waitress arrives. Cholerics—stereotyped
eaters—seldom vary their menu from one day to the next and
when it arrives, they bolt it down in big chunks, often talking
while chewing their food. Melancholies are very picky eaters. It
takes them forever to make up their minds about what to order,
but once it arrives they savor every bite. Phlegmatics are the
most deliberate eaters of all and are invariably the last ones
through eating. That is the main reason they rarely gain weight
(All weight specialists warn obese patients to eat slowly, for it
takes twenty minutes for food passing into the mouth to shut
off hunger pangs.)
TEMPERAMENT AND DRIVING
SKILLS
Sanguines are erratic drivers. Sometimes they speed, then for
no apparent reason lose interest in driving fast and slow down.
They are so people-oriented that they want to look you in the
face when talking, even while driving.
Cholerics are daring speed demons who dart in and out of
traffic constantly. They always try to get more accomplished in
a given period of time than is humanly possible and attempt to
make up time by driving furiously between appointments.
Melancholy motorists never leave home without preparing
for the trip well in advance. They study the map and know the
best route from A to Z. Of all the temperaments, they are the
most likely to keep a complete log of their driving history,
including gas and oil consumption and car repairs. Legalists by
nature, they rarely speed.
Phil Phlegmatic is the slowest driver of all. The last one to
leave an intersection, he rarely changes lanes and is an
indecisive danger when joining the flow of freeway traffic from
an entrance ramp. He is a pokey “Sunday driver” seven days a
week. He gets few tickets and rarely has accidents, but he can
be a road hazard.
TEMPERAMENT AND THE WAY YOU
SHOP
Sanguines are not price conscious, but select for visual
satisfaction. They are drawn by colorful packaging and
advertising In the grocery store, theirs is the most overloaded
cart.
Cholerics, particularly men, are not fond of shopping. They
only go to the store when they need something and want to
purchase it and get out Like sanguines, they usually overbuy
but not quite as much.
Melancholies are deliberate and decisive shoppers who
compare prices and quality quite carefully. They run their
hands over the item, try it on two or three times, leave the store
a time or two, and if it isn’t sold by the time they return, they
buy it They create traffic jams waiting to make up their mind. In
the grocery store they know where everything is and save all
the coupons fromevery manufacturer.
Phlegmatics, particularly women, enjoy shopping. They take
longer, shop slower, and are probably more frugal than any
other type. They are almost as indecisive as the melancholy.
They have to shop more frequently than any other type
because they don’t get enough on the first trip.
TEMPERAMENT AND YARD
CARE
As incredible as it may seem, you can almost decipher a
person’s temperament by the way he does the yard work
around his home. Sparky Sanguine gets up early Saturday
morning to fix his yard. With great gusto he lines up all his
tools (he has every gadget known to man because he totally
lacks sales resistance) and prepares to cut, trim, shear, and
prune. However, within thirty minutes he is chatting joyfully
with a neighbor. Before the day is over, he orders his son to
“put my tools away” and decides to fix the yard next week.
Sparky is clearly one of the world’s great procrastinators.
Rocky Choleric hates yard work, and therefore when he does
it at all it is with a vengeance. He works at a frenzied pace in
order to get the job done, and neatness is not his hallmark. One
can usually spot the choleric’s yard while driving through the
neighborhood. Just look for miniature hedges and dwarf trees.
Martin Melancholy has a natural aptitude for growing things
and usually maintains the best yard in the neighborhood. He is
the one who talks to and babies his plants, and on almost any
weekend we will find him on hands and knees, “manicuring”
his lawns and hedges.
The phlegmatic’s lawn usually suggests that its owner is still
in the house late on a Saturday morning, sipping his third cup
of coffee—because he is. Capable of superior lawn care, Phil
will scrupulously attend to “the old plantation,” however,
because his desire to rest is overcome by his drive to do the
accepted thing.
TEMPERAMENT AND STUDY
HABITS
Melancholies are usually good students who enjoy learning.
They have inquisitive minds and if taught to read well will have
a ferocious appetite for books. They are blessed with keen
retentive minds that enable them to remember a multitude of
details. As a rule they are good spellers because they take
mental pictures of each word. Although they have messy files
and a desk top that is impossible to organize, they have an
amazing concentration regardless of the mess, interruptions, or
noise going on around them.
Phlegmatics can be good students if their procrastination
doesn’t catch up with them. They need a series of short-term
assignments rather than long-term projects. They work best
under pressure, though they claim they don’t like it They have
orderly minds capable of analysis and deductions. They are
prone to get their news more from TV than magazines and
newspapers. They have good memories and can be intelligent
people if somehow motivated to learn.
Cholerics are clever as a rule but not brilliant They like the
people-oriented subjects such as history, geography, literature,
and psychology. They may not be good spellers, because they
skim over things so quickly. They are adept at speed-reading
and have curious minds. They constantly ask “Why?”
Cholerics love charts, diagrams, and graphs; they like to know
where everything fits in the main scheme of things. They may
have a difficult time concentrating on anything that reminds
them of other goals or projects that get their minds off on a
tangent and then may have a difficult time getting back to the
subject at hand.
Sanguines, unless endowed with a high IQ, are not usually
good students. They can be if they are motivated, because
they are often bright enough, but they are very restless and
undisciplined. They have a short interest span and anything
can be a distraction, from a bird flying overhead to a picture on
the wall These people have incredible potential but usually
squander it because they don’t discipline themselves.
Concentration for long periods of time is difficult for them.
HANDWRITING AND YOUR
TEMPERAMENT
I am not an authority on handwriting, but I have observed that
temperament and handwriting analysis are very similar. Our
penmanship usually follows our temperament Everything a
sanguine does is expressive and flamboyant, and he writes that
way. The choleric usually has poor handwriting. Everything he
does is fast; consequently, he does not take time to write
legibly. The phlegmatic usually has small but neat handwriting.
Melancholies have the most unpredictable handwriting of all.
They are extremely complexpeople and usually write that way.
COMMUNICATION SKILLS
AND TEMPERAMENT
Thinking skills and communication skills are not based solely
on the brain. They also involve temperament. Sanguines are
intuitive speakers. They are overly expressive and use
exaggeration freely. Cholerics are extroverted enough to speak
freely, but usually are more deliberate than sanguines. They are
debaters and arguers; no one can be more biting or sarcastic.
Melancholies never start talking until they have thought out
precisely what they want to say. They don’t like to interrupt
others, but once they get started they go on until they have
unloaded their entire message. Phlegmatics are quiet about
everything and seldom enter into debates or thrust themselves
into conversations. They will respond to questions with wit
and good humor, but rarely volunteer anything unless asked.
Peter was told, “Your speech betrays you” (Matt 26:73).
That is often true of your temperament; your speech patterns
are a giveaway of your temperament.
BILL PAYING AND
TEMPERAMENT
Paying bills is a necessary part of life, and it seems to get more
complex all the time. Believe it or not, unless you are a trained
bookkeeper, the way you tackle that problemwill be a reflection
of your temperament.
Sanguines are terrible record-keepers. They dislike detail and
can get momentarily depressed with their overspending habits.
Their method of handling deficit spending is rarely to cut down
on their standard of living, but simply to try to make more
money. They pay their bills, but it usually takes several
reminders.
Cholerics like to pay bills on time. They aren’t very detailed
unless they have a melancholy or phlegmatic secondary
temperament, but they like things orderly. Their style is to put
all the bills in one place and pay them all the same night each
month. They aren’t “bugged” if their checkbook doesn’t
balance, just so they keep the bank honest For $5 or $10 they
will accept the bank’s balance—they figure their time spent
hassling over the details is worth more than that Melancholies
are perfectionists. Their conscientious nature makes them
difficult to live with if they don’t pay all their creditors on time.
Their bill cabinet is a mess, but they know what each statement
and receipt is. They usually have every receipt for the past five
years, but in no set order. They pride themselves on balancing
their checkbook to the penny. If there is a mistake, it will be the
bank’s. They usually have a triple “A” credit rating.
Phlegmatics systemize everything They have a detailed
budget and keep matching records. They not only pay bills on
time, they like to get them in early wherever it saves an
additional 2 or 4 percent. (Sanguines don’t even realize there
are companies that do this.) To some phlegs, balancing their
checkbook is the highlight of their month. It is the one clear
signal that their life is in order and they are ready to launch into
the next month.
CHILD DISCIPLINE AND YOUR
TEMPERAMENT
Child discipline is largely a result of family tradition, religious
training, culture, and temperament In recent years there have
been a number of books written on this subject, some good,
some very harmful. Those who base their philosophy on
humanistic values or humanistic psychology have produced a
permissive society that tends toward lawlessness. Books
based on biblical principles have, on the other hand, been very
valuable. My three favorite books on child discipline are two
by my friend Dr. James Dobson (Dare to Discipline and The
Strong-Willed Child) and one by my wife, Beverly: How to
Develop Your Child’s Temperament. These three books
should be in every Christian parent’s library. If you study
them, you will be equipped to be a maximumparent.
Having said all of that, however, you will find that unless
you learn what is right in disciplining your children, you will
respond to them according to your temperament Even when
you know what to do, your temperament will influence the way
you do it Consider these four familiar styles.
Everything a sanguine does in life is spontaneous, and
discipline is usually no exception. He is loud in his instruction
and correction, and a woman sanguine is apt to be a screamer.
Since sanguines are not disciplined themselves, their threats
are rarely carried out; so Johnny knows he never has to answer
the first time he is called or told to do something. He waits until
the pitch of the scream or the volume of the call gets to a
certain intensity before he comes home. When it comes to spankings, sanguines must do it
immediately, while they are angry or frustrated, or they
probably won’t do it at all. Their tender heart and forgiving
spirit make delayed punishment no punishment Their leniency
leads to permissiveness, which in turn encourages
lawlessness. And inconsistent parents usually raise
inconsistent children.
One thing is commendable about sanguines: after they have
disciplined their children, they take time to love and comfort
them. Sanguines never carry grudges (we could all do with a bit
of that). Another thing about these fun-loving people is that
they will often take time to play with their children, particularly
as they get older.
Cholerics, being authority-prone, want to run their homes
like a Marine boot camp. This may produce good robots, but it
doesn’t do much for kids. The child of a choleric parent never
lacks knowledge of what his parent requires in the way of
obedience and rules—he is told regularly. Cholerics love to
give out orders. Choleric spankers tend to spank too hard too
often and too many spanks per discipline. Masters of the
overkill in all that they do, their motto is, “If a little helps, a lot
will cure.” (In reality, no parent should spank a child when
angry. He makes the child feel he is just a release valve for the
parent’s frustration.)
Cholerics can be good parents, but they have to work at it
They are hard to please at best, and if a child is a “late
bloomer” or of a less activist temperament, such parents are apt
to make her feel inferior and constantly disapproved. Such
parents need to encourage their children, approve them, and
build up their self-image, going out of their way to show their
love.
Melancholy parents were perfectionists before they became
parents, and having children won’t change that They have
high-to-unreal expectations for their young and dole out praise
sparingly (although most children need it lavishly).
Academically, their children know that anything less than an
“A” is a failure—in every subject Legalistic by nature, they
usually have rules for everything and procedures that must be
followed. If they say they will spank for a particular offense,
they usually follow through; but rarely do they over-spank,
unless they see their own shortcomings in their child. Then
they may take out on the child the frustrations they have
toward themselves.
It is hard for melancholies to be approving because their
standard is so high and because they are afraid their child will
become complacent with approval They are the last
temperament to learn that everyone needs praise and that most
people thrive better on approval than on condemnation. They
have a great capacity to love their children, but they need to
learn how to express it One of the biggest parental failings is
that they never forget anything wrong the child has done, and
if not trained out of the habit will bring it up again and again.
Phlegmatics can be good parents if they learn to be more
assertive and confrontational when necessary. They are
patience personified. They love children and probably feel
more comfortable with little children than anyone else. They
take time with them, play with them, and can be patient trainers.
As choleric children get older, phlegmatic parents may be
intimidated by them and look the other way, thus undermining
in the teen years the good training they gave in childhood.
However, the one thing they may indulge in (melancholies can
be guilty of this also) is to permit their children to sass them.
No parent should accept this. The Bible says children are to
honor their parents. If they don’t honor them with their
mouths, they must at least be forced not to dishonor them.
Parents who lose that battle in childhood seldom gain control
in the teen years.
The phlegmatic is the least likely to spank. He usually waits
until the more extroverted parent does it When the teen years
come and the child needs a forceful father figure, it is sad when
Dad goes to the garage and putters at his workbench to avoid
unpleasant confrontations. I once counseled a phlegmatic man
whose conflict with his wife arose because she wouldn’t forbid
the kids to watch certain TV shows he felt were objectionable.
Children need two parents to agree on rules and to enforce
them, applying whatever punishment is appropriate or
promised. Phlegmatics can be good parents but, like the rest of
us, they have to work at it.
SUMMARY
We could go on giving illustrations of how temperament
influences the way you exercise, sleep, decorate, select clothes,
have hobbies, and do everything else in your life. But these are
enough to get you started in the right direction. As you
become more familiar with the temperament theory, you will see
it at work in your own life and that of your friends.
Why You Act the Way You Do
Everyone is interested in human behavior. That is why over
80 percent of our nation’s 13 million college students
voluntarily take psychology classes; they are fascinated by
what makes people tick And most of all, they are interested in
why they think feel, respond, explode, and act the way they do.
Nothing answers those questions better than the theory of
the four temperaments. It explains differences in people—their
tastes, their creative capabilities, their strengths and
weaknesses. It explains why some people conflict with others
and why others are attracted to each other.
