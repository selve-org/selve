# VOCATIONAL FRUSTRATION

Next to lack of employment, the worst thing that can happen to a person is to have the wrong job. It is incredible how many people despise their work. No wonder it becomes such drudgery to them. And as technology advances, increasing numbers of people will discover they are ill-fitted for the vocation in which they find themselves. This is particularly true of the unskilled or those whose area of skill is automated out of existence. All vocational experts warn that this will be an increasing problem in the years ahead.

One of the ways to avoid vocational frustration, or feeling like a round peg in a square hole, is to know your temperament and its natural vocational possibilities, then find work or a profession that allows you to express your natural temperament characteristics. Examine this brief exposure to the four temperaments' vocational aptitudes and see if they sound familiar.

## SPARKY SANGUINE'S VOCATIONAL APTITUDES

The world is enriched by sanguines with their cheeriness and natural charisma. They usually make excellent salesmen and more than any other seem attracted to that profession. Sparky is so convincing that he could sell rubber crutches to people who aren't even crippled. If you ever want to watch Mr. Sanguine in action, just visit your local used-car dealer. Two-thirds of his salesmen are probably sanguines.

In addition to being good salesmen, sanguines make excellent actors, entertainers, and preachers (particularly evangelists). They are outstanding masters of ceremonies, auctioneers, and sometimes leaders (if properly blended with another temperament). Because of our mass media today, they are increasingly in demand within the political arena, where natural charisma has proven advantageous (sanguines have charisma to burn).

In the area of helping people, sanguines excel as hospital workers. Doctor Sanguine always has the best bedside manner. You may be on the verge of death, as white as the sheet you are lying on when he bubbles into the room, but before he leaves, he will lift your spirits by his natural charm. His obvious compassion in response to your tale of woe will almost make paying his exorbitant bill easy. (Sanguines are never moderate about anything.) Nurse Sanguine is equally enthusiastic about helping sick folk, and her radiant smile as she enters the room always gives you a pickup. In fact, most sick people respond to the sanguine's question of "How are you today?" by saying, "Fine," whereas Nurse Melancholy asking the same question would probably receive the self-pitying lament of "Miserable."

No matter what work the sanguine enters, it should always give him extensive exposure to people. I think his chief contribution to life lies in making other people happy. Certainly someone should be assigned that task in these uncertain times.

It is well known that sanguines are not too swift on detail. One of their biggest frustrations is the sales manager that wants them to use "purchase orders" or "fill in all the blanks on contracts." Most sanguines can't even remember where they put the contracts, much less fill them out. They would much rather be out on the golf course with a client than strategizing, analyzing, or filling out forms. Most sanguines lament, "Paperwork is the bane of my life."

While it is true sanguines are not natural detail hounds, they can do better. It is all a matter of self-discipline. That seems to be the most self-limiting thing a sanguine does: indulge his weaknesses and refuse to discipline himself. It is sad to have to say it, but sanguines usually limit their ultimate potential by their failure to discipline themselves. Every job has something undesirable about it, and changing jobs won't change that. Sooner or later you will find something in your new job that you don't like to do.

When my wife and I launched a national television program, we thought it would be an exciting way to serve our Lord. We thoroughly enjoyed the filming of the programs, the meeting of new people, the exciting experience of learning a new field, and, of course, helping millions of people instead of thousands. But I had not counted on the 224 fund-raising meetings all over the country during a recessionary year. I hated them! I love to teach and preach the Bible, but asking people for money to finance even this effective ministry? It was the hardest thing I have ever done in the work of God. In fact, I was tempted to quit 223 times.

Now that such meetings are behind us, I'm glad we didn't quit under fire. A long time ago I learned that God is interested in finishers, not starters. Sanguines are so capable they look for instant success, but are not used to putting their head down and ploughing on in the face of difficulty, opposition, or frustration.

Once they learned that lesson, there is no limit to what God can do with them vocationally.

## ROCKY CHOLERIC'S VOCATIONAL POTENTIAL

Any profession that requires leadership, motivation, and productivity is open to a choleric, provided it does not require too much attention to details and analytical planning. Committee meetings and long-range planning bore him, for he is a doer. Although he is not usually a craftsman (which requires a degree of perfection and efficiency usually beyond his capability), he often serves as a supervisor for craftsmen.

He usually enjoys construction because he is so productive and will frequently end up as a foreman or project supervisor. Rocky is a developer by nature. When he and his wife drive through the countryside, he cannot share her enjoyment of the "beautiful rolling hillsides," for he envisions road graders carving out streets and builders constructing homes, schools, and shopping centers. Most of today's cities and suburbs were first envisioned by a choleric. You can be sure, however, that he hired a melancholy as the architect with the analytical and creative ability to draw the plans he has outlined, for he could never do that himself. He still can't understand why a few lines on the back of an envelope aren't sufficient to gain the city planning department's approval. No one fights City Hall harder than a choleric, who bitterly laments, "Why all this business of detailed plans, anyway? I've built enough projects to know that the best plans have to be modified during construction; so why not make up your mind as you go along on the little issues? I know what I want to accomplish!" It is a wise choleric who hires a melancholy as his assistant or goes into business partnership with a melancholy. Together they make an unbeatable team. Of course, since everyone has both a primary and secondary temperament occasionally one meets a person with both traits.

Most entrepreneurs are cholerics. They formulate the ideas and are venturesome enough to launch out in new directions. They don't limit themselves to their own ideas either, but sometimes overhear a creative idea from someone who is not sufficiently adventurous to initiate a new business or project. Once Rocky has started a new business, however, it is not unlike him to get bored soon after it is successful. There are two reasons for this. First as the business grows under his dynamic leadership, of necessity it creates more detail work. But since cholerics are not by nature good delegators of responsibility (although with proper training they can learn) and tend to prefer the fruits of their own productive and capable industry, the efforts of others are evaluated as somewhat inadequate. Consequently, they end up trying to do everything themselves. Second, when visionary Rocky finds himself so inundated with the mass of details this successful venture has spawned, he looks for a buyer to assume those responsibilities in order to free his own time to launch something new. Thus, the average choleric can be expected to start four to ten businesses or organizations in a lifetime.

Once a choleric learns to delegate responsibility to others and discovers that he is able to accomplish more through other people, he can complete an amazing amount of work. Other people cannot believe that he can be involved in so many things and keep his sanity, but to Rocky Choleric it is really very simple. Since he is completely performance-conscious and has no perfectionist hang-ups, he will reason, "I'd rather get a number of things finished 70 to 80 percent than a few things 100 percent." As Charlie "Tremendous" Jones says in his talks to businessmen, "Your motto should be: From production to perfection." Cholerics love that philosophy, perfectionist melancholies reject it vigorously.

Rocky Choleric is a natural motivator of other people. He oozes self-confidence, is extremely goal-conscious, and can inspire others to envision his goals. Consequently, his associates may find themselves more productive by following his lead. His primary weakness as a leader is that he is hard to please and tends to run roughshod over other people. If he only knew how others look to him for approval and encouragement, he would spend more time patting them on the back and acknowledging their accomplishments, which would generate even greater dedication from his colleagues. The problem is, however, the choleric subconsciously thinks that approval and encouragement will lead to complacency, and he assumes that an employee's productivity will fall off if he is too complimentary. Thus he will resort to criticism and fault-finding, in the hope that this will inspire greater effort. Unfortunately, he must learn that criticism is a demotivator.

Once Rocky discovers that people require reassurance and stimulation in order to perform at the height of their potential, his role as leader radically improves.

Learn a lesson from football's middle linebackers just before a crucial play. They walk up and down the line patting their teammates encouragingly. That touch silently urges, "I'm counting on you to do your best; don't let me down." As one lineman said of his defensive captain, "I'd lay down my life for that man!" Interestingly enough, the captain was a perennial back-patter.

In the early days of American industry, when business production and manufacturing were not so technical, our industrial complexes were largely built by cholerics. In these days as technology demands greater sophistication and creativity, it is gradually turning for leadership to melancholies or at least choleric/melancholies or melancholy/cholerics. Today cholerics are more apt to build the factory buildings or the streets and highways which furnish the supply routes used by industry, whereas complex organization increasingly requires a more analytical leader.

Don't feel sorry for the choleric of the future; he will figure out something worthy of his talents. He always lands on his feet. Cholerics have a built-in promotional ability and do well in sales, teaching (but always practical subjects), politics, military service, sports, and many other endeavors. Like the sanguine, Rocky Choleric makes a good preacher in the pulpit. Not only is he a dynamic Bible teacher, but his organization and promotional ability together with his strong leadership gifts make it hard for the average fearful congregation to slow him down. According to an old saying, "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread." No one ever accused a choleric of being an angel. He launches into many projects and, with proper motivation and the blessing of God, usually enjoys a successful ministry.

Western civilization has benefited much from its Rocky Cholerics (Nordic, Teutonic, Germanic, Gallic, or Frankish people often had a high degree of choleric temperament). But it has suffered much from them also. The world's greatest generals, dictators, and gangsters have been mainly cholerics. What made the difference? Their moral values and motivations. If there is such a thing as a "success tendency," cholerics have it. That doesn't mean they are smarter than other people, as is often assumed, but that their strong will and determination drive them to succeed where other more gifted people are prone to give up in the midst of their superior projects. If a job requires industry, hard work, and activity, Rocky Choleric will usually outperform the other temperaments. If it demands analysis, long-range planning, meticulous skills, or creativity, that's a different ballgame. Rarely will you find a predominant choleric as a surgeon, dentist, philosopher, inventor, or watchmaker. Rocky's interests thrive upon activity, bigness, violence, and production. He is so optimistic, rarely anticipating failure, that he seldom fails—except at home.

## VOCATIONAL POSSIBILITIES OF MARTIN MELANCHOLY

As a general rule, no other temperament has a higher IQ, creativity, or imagination than a melancholy, and no one else is as capable of perfectionism. Most of the world's great composers, artists, musicians, inventors, philosophers, theoreticians, theologians, scientists, and dedicated educators have been predominantly melancholies. Name a famous artist, composer, or orchestra leader and you have identified another genius and an often eccentric melancholy. Consider Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner, and a host of others. Usually the greater the degree of genius, the greater will be the predominance of a melancholy temperament.

Any vocation that requires perfection, self-sacrifice, and creativity is open to a Martin Melancholy. However, he tends to place self-imposed limitations on his potential by underestimating himself and exaggerating obstacles. Almost any humanitarian vocation will attract melancholies to its staff.

For years I have watched doctors, and although there are bound to be exceptions, almost every doctor I know is either predominantly or at least secondarily a melancholy. It would almost require a melancholy's mind to get through the rigors of medical school, for a doctor has to be a perfectionist, an analytical specialist and a humanitarian propelled by a heart that yearns to help other people.

The analytical ability required to design buildings, lay out a landscape, or look at acreage and envision a cohesive development usually requires a melancholy temperament. In the building trades the melancholy may want to supervise construction. However, he would be better off hiring a project supervisor who works better with people and then spend his own time on the drawing board. He becomes frustrated by the usual personnel problems and, with his unrealistic perfectionist demands, adds to them.

Almost every true musician has some melancholy temperament whether he be a composer, choral conductor, performing artist, or soloist. This often accounts for the melancholy's lament that seems to find its way into so much of our music—both in and out of the church. Just yesterday my wife and I were driving to the airport when a country-western tune was crooned (or warbled, depending on your point of view) over the radio. We looked at each other and laughed as the wail of the obvious melancholy became so apparent—and that song is one of today's top tunes.

The influence of temperament on a person's musical ability was apparent several years ago as our church evaluated a very gifted minister of music and his piano-playing wife, obviously a choleric. On the way home I reflected to my wife that I couldn't understand how a choleric could be such a good pianist. Beverly replied, "She is a mechanical musician. By strong willpower she forced herself to play the piano well, but she doesn't feel her music." As it turned out, the fantastic arrangement she used that night had been written by her husband, a melancholy. Although he was not a pianist, he could feel music.

Not all melancholies, of course, enter the professions or arts. Many become craftsmen of a high quality—finish carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, plasterers, scientists, nurserymen, playwrights, authors, mechanics, engineers, and members of almost every profession that provides a meaningful service to humanity. One vocation that seems to attract the melancholy, surprisingly enough, is acting, though we tend to identify this profession with an extrovert. On stage, the melancholy can become another person and even adopt that personality, no matter how much extroversion it requires; but as soon as the play is over and he comes down from his emotional high, he reverts back to his own more introverted personality.

## VOCATIONAL APTITUDES OF THE PHLEGMATIC

The world has benefited greatly from the gracious nature of Phil Phlegmatic. In his quiet way he has proved to be a fulfiller of the dreams of others. He is a master at anything that requires meticulous patience and daily routine.

Most elementary school teachers are phlegmatics. Who but a phlegmatic could have the patience necessary to teach a group of first-graders to read? A sanguine would spend the entire class period telling stories to the children. A melancholy would so criticize them that they would be afraid to read aloud. And I can't even imagine a choleric as a first-grade teacher—the students would leap out the windows! The gentle nature of the phlegmatic assures the ideal atmosphere for such learning. This is not only true on the elementary level but in both high school and college, particularly in math, physics, grammar, literature, language classes, and others. It is not uncommon to find phlegmatics as school administrators, librarians, counselors, and college department heads. Phlegmatics seem drawn to the field of education.

Another field that appeals to phlegmatics is engineering. Attracted to planning and calculation, they make good structural engineers, sanitation experts, chemical engineers, draftsmen, mechanical and civil engineers, and statisticians. Most phlegmatics have excellent mechanical aptitude and thus become good mechanics, tool-and-die specialists, craftsmen, carpenters, electricians, plasterers, glassblowers, watch and camera repairmen.

The biggest problem faced by industry pertains to personnel. With wages for many jobs skyrocketing, disharmony in a department can so demotivate employees that the employer may lose millions of dollars in productivity. In recent years, management has begun to discover that experienced phlegmatics in their employ often make excellent foremen, supervisors, and managers of people. Because they are diplomatic and unabrasive, people work well with them. When given positions of leadership, they seem to bring order out of chaos and produce a working harmony that is conducive to increased productivity. They are well organized, never come to a meeting unprepared or late, tend to work well under pressure, and are extremely dependable. Phlegmatics often stay with one company for their entire working career.

An interesting aspect of their leadership ability is that they almost never volunteer for authoritative responsibilities, which is why I labeled them "reluctant leaders." Secretly a phlegmatic may aspire for a promotion, but it would be against his nature to volunteer. Instead, he may patiently wait until more discordant and inept personalities make a mess out of things and then assume the responsibility only after it is forced upon him. Unfortunately, in many instances phlegmatics wait their lives away and opportunity never knocks—because although employers appreciate their capabilities, they don't envision them as leaders. Consequently, both the company and the employees lose. Rarely does a phlegmatic either live up to his full capabilities or fail in life.

Phlegmatics may take a job with retirement or security benefits in mind. Therefore, civil service, the military, local government or some other "good security risk" will attract them. Rarely will they launch out on a business venture of their own, although they are eminently qualified to do so. Instead they usually enhance the earning power of someone else and are quite content with a simple life-style.

# Uses of Temperament in the Workplace

As a student of psychology for over thirty years, I long ago made the observation that the business community had a much more effective model of human behavior than did the academic. The colleges seemed obsessed with humanistic psychology that started out on so many false premises we shouldn't be surprised that it changes every few years. We have seen Freudian psychology, once the shrine before which the university crowd gladly bowed, replaced by Rogerianism, behaviorism, Gestalt theory, reality therapy, transactional analysis, and much frustration—particularly by the patients whose only consistent observation was the exorbitant bill that came to their home each month.

What are the false premises of humanistic psychology? Very simply that (1) man is an evolved animal; (2) man has no inherited conscience; (3) there is no creator God; (4) there is no absolute standard for behavior given by that God; (5) man, like the animals, has no soul—so when you're dead you're dead; and (6) man's ultimate end is self-actualization.

Given those basic assumptions, it is no wonder modern psychology has wrought such havoc in our society. We have more schizophrenic, mentally ill, depressed, suicidal, hostile, and upset people today than before we had psychologists. The reason is very simple. A basic axiom of all logic is: If you start out on a wrong premise, you will end up with a wrong conclusion. I've counseled enough psychologists and their wives to know that their solutions, without God, are impractical. They just don't work! Much of the advice given by secular humanist psychologists is not only wrong, but harmful.

Business is quite a different matter. Industrial psychology may not be given much schrift in the halls of academia, but it helps far more people than clinical psychology. And interestingly enough, it is based on the theory of the four temperaments.

For some reason, American psychologists have been heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud, although they have discounted many of his obsolete theories and developed a godless modern version of their own. But few American professors have embraced the scholarly works of Dr. H. J. Eysenck of England. He is highly respected in Europe and in the industrial, sales, and management fields of psychology in this country. In fact, most of the popular programs used in business management, sales, and personal development are based on his exhaustive research. And Dr. Eysenck is an advocate of the four temperament theory, which he ascribes to Hippocrates.

The Educational and Industrial Testing Service is a San Diego-based company that produces the E.P.I.—Eysenck Personality Inventory. The following diagram (Fig. 1) is an Eysenck trademark of both his books and this test. Note how similar it is to the basic chart (Fig. 2) which I have refined from many other sources plus my own observations. The similarities are such that both are obviously based on the ancient theory of the four temperaments.



**FIGURE I**

Through the years I have received hundreds of letters from people who have read my books on temperament or have heard my lectures on the subject. Many of those letters are about personality testing they have gone through, sales management training, or vocational training programs they have taken. In all the materials I have received, there is a consistent similarity to the four temperament theory. I have studied these materials, whether produced in Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago, or Dallas; I find they are based on the careful research of Dr. Eysenck or the theory of the four temperaments or both.

## HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

For example, in the Harvard Business Review, published by the graduate school of business administration of Harvard University, Dr. Theodore Levitt wrote an interesting article entitled "The Managerial Merry-go-round," in which he points out "People have different cognitive styles—that is, ways of gathering and evaluating information. Some are systematic thinkers, others intuitive thinkers, some are receptive thinkers and others perceptive thinkers. These styles seem to be inherent and are fairly fixed by the time people reach maturity. What is even more instructive is that the research found that these styles greatly affect the way people perform the jobs they choose, and can even determine the industries they enter" (Fact and Fiction in Psychology, Penguin Books, 1965, p. 55).

You will notice that this article is divergent from humanistic psychology's claim that all people are born neutral and that environment molds one's behavior. The business community recognizes that it is worthwhile to train management personnel at every level, but it also recognizes that there are inborn characteristics in people that are irreversible.

"Each of us marches to a different drummer, the secret of good teamwork is blending contrasting executive styles," argue Stuart Atkins and Allan Katcher, president and vice-president respectively of Atkins-Katcher Associates, Inc., management consultants in Beverly Hills, California. The following excerpts appeared in Nation's Business (March 1975):

> To get the best performance from your executive team, you have to orchestrate them, getting each to give his best and helping them to blend their strengths for peak performance as a group. To achieve this, you must analyze their different styles of operating. Everyone is a mixture of four basic behavior patterns, usually with one dominating. The others, less used, come into play when the situation calls for them. There are, however, no "good" or "bad" styles.
>
> A person whose dominant style is Supporting-Giving tends to be trusting, responsive, idealistic and loyal. He tries to do the very best he can whenever you assign him a task, and he sets high standards for himself and his people. Highly receptive to others' ideas, he cooperates and is helpful, a natural team player.

# CHAPTER EIGHT
# Other Ways to Use the Four Temperament Theory

The four-temperament theory is not a cure-all for everything, but it certainly is a good tool to use in helping us get along with other people. I have always presented it with two primary uses in mind: self-improvement, and improving your interpersonal relationships. But there are many other ways which you will find helpful. I shall suggest a dozen or so, then you can add some of your own.

I have found the temperament theory to be most helpful, and there is no end to the uses or applications you can make for it. However, the first and best use is on yourself. Once you have learned the theory and how to strengthen your own weaknesses, you will find it helpful in the following ways:

## 1. Counseling others.

I mention counseling to begin with because that is one place I have personally used it in helping thousands of people. It is a wonderful tool for diagnosing people's problems. You cannot help anyone unless you know what their root problem is. Many times the things they say are not the real cause of their difficulties. To me, counseling is helping people apply biblical principles to their lives where they cannot apply them alone. Most counselees don't know why they are so miserable. Consequently, the first thing any counselor does is listen and try to diagnose the individual's major difficulty. If you understand the four temperaments, it streamlines the diagnostic process.

By watching the counselee carefully for giveaway signs through body language, speech, attitudes, and the general flow of their conversation, it is usually easy to diagnose an upset person's primary temperament. Once I have done this, I look for problems associated with their temperament. If he is a sanguine, I look for anger, insecurity, lack of discipline, and sometimes immorality. If he is choleric, I look for anger, bitterness, and other forms of hostility, self-justification, coldness, or eruptions and a tendency to run roughshod over others. If I am working with a melancholy person, I expect self-condemnation, depression, self-limitation, criticism, a negative and critical spirit, or ingratitude toward God and others. In a melancholy man I sometimes anticipate male impotence or in a woman the frustration of frigidity. Phlegmatics tend to clutter their lives with worry, fear, procrastination, and lack of motivation. I rarely have discovered immorality among phlegmatic men; but occasionally a phlegmatic woman, due to her tendency to "go along and keep the peace," may give in to the temptation.

All of these problems and others for the various temperaments need to be considered and addressed in the counseling room. Unless an individual is confronted with biblical standards of behavior, he will not be lastingly helped. Once you diagnose and confront the individual with the problem, she needs a spiritual prescription to build the cure on. But the administration of the prescription should be given with her temperament in view. Sanguines and phlegmatics need a midweek call just to check up on their faithfulness. They need that extra prod to get going. The choleric needs to be assured that the formula will work, and the melancholy needs to keep from making a three-hour production out of a twenty-minute a day assignment.

Counseling people can be an enjoyable experience if you see progress in most of them. Knowing and using the temperament theory is a tool for improving the counselor's success ratio.

## 2. Using the temperament theory in selling.

The salesman who approaches people according to their temperaments will be more successful than the one who approaches everyone alike. People differ, and good salesmen know it and approach them accordingly.

**Sanguines** are impulse buyers and are notorious for having no sales resistance. They aren't interested in details, but enjoy success stories. They love being entertained, and usually they enact their biggest deals on the golf course or in the restaurant. Be sure to stress feelings, ego, and "everyone has one" and usually you will make a sale (80 percent of the time). Get a good down payment though, for he changes his mind easily.

**Cholerics** are tougher to sell. Being practical, they respond to need. Why do they need it? How will they use it? What real value does it have? How much will it be worth five years from now? Ask his opinion and listen as if to an expert. He loves bargains; so give him a discount. He is opinionated; so get the kind and color he wants. Don't try to con him, but be sure and show him how he can pay for it. If you have been convincing, he may buy. Don't clutter your presentation with too much detail. Give one or two success stories, but don't waste his "valuable time" talking too much. If he really wants what you have, he is a 70 percent sales prospect and not usually given to shopping around. Let him see it and handle it; then back off. He will sell himself.

**Melancholies** need facts, statistics, charts, and detail. Don't try to bluff them! If you don't know your product, don't even bother to call on them. They can ask more questions about your product than both the inventor and manufacturer ever thought of. When he asks a question, find the answer. But always tell the truth; he has a memory like an elephant. Leave a good brochure, go find the answer, and then return. He has thousands of honest doubts and questions. Treat all his doubts and criticisms as requests for more information. He only buys the best he can afford; so convince him your product is the best on the market for the price. (If it isn't go work for the best or don't try to sell him.) He doesn't want to hear a lot of success stories. He wants to know what your product will do for him, his home, or his company. Don't try to entertain him. He prides himself on the fact that he can't be bought. Send him something at Christmas time or after your first sale. Build a relationship of reliability and see that your firm services his account, and he will become a customer for years. Sales prospects are 50-50, but he gets terrible buyer's remorse the day after signing a contract. A follow-up call and enthusiastic report do wonders. And be sure to instruct him or his people on the use of your product. Remember, you're building a lifetime client. He has that potential.

**Phlegmatics** love to be "sold," but cannot be pressured. They like a combination of detail and success stories. They buy for many reasons, including prestige and practicality. Rarely do they buy the top of the line. Remember, they are not flamboyant. They prefer the stripped-down version. Give them plenty of latitude in choosing a price range ($20,000 or $50,000). Let them guide you to their needs. They beg to be entertained and love to be persuaded. Invite their wives along; it makes them feel important. They ask intelligent questions and must have all their fears assuaged or it's "no sale." Help them to see that your product will save money in the long run. Treat them with respect; don't fawn over them, but answer their questions and go back until they buy. The more attention you give them, the more obligated they feel. But after the sale, if you drop them like a hot potato they may never buy from you again. Like the melancholy, they can develop "buyer's remorse." They need assurance after the sale that they did the right thing—another success story or news about another company that just bought your product will do it. They usually use their old equipment one or two years longer than others.

I heard an interesting thing in a Chicago airport as I was writing the above. A businessman who identified himself as a "salesman for a major household product" and I began talking, and he asked what I was writing. When I described the four-temperament approach to selling, his eyes opened wide and I asked if he agreed. His response was interesting: "I can name people and describe examples of these four types. We deal with them every day."

## 3. Using temperaments in managing people.

Good management involves selection, training, motivating, and controlling people as they work harmoniously toward a united goal. The first and most important thing in good management is to put the right people in the right place. We have already seen how understanding the four temperaments and applying this to people is helpful. But it is also a good tool for managers to use in getting the most out of people once they are on the payroll.

**Sanguines** are predictably unpredictable. Their natural lack of discipline makes them late and unprepared when they come to work each day. Either they must be trained to do detail work or provided with a secretary who can do it for them. Their greatest asset is production and sales. Don't expect them to conform to all company policy. The biggest task a manager has is guiding them to spend 90 percent of their time in their most productive area. If they cannot conform, they will become liabilities. I know a salesman who could not resist the temptation to throw in extra goodies to his customers and make extra promises that were not company policy in order to make sales. The company president told me, "He made so many sales his commissions were more than my salary. And when we fired him for giving away the company store, we discovered that his expenses, commissions, shipping charges, etc., cost us $800,000 more than our profits." Obviously, such individuals need close supervision, but they don't like it.

**Cholerics** are self-starters and quick-learners. Don't be afraid to delegate responsibility to them. But make sure they fully understand the guidelines, objectives, and limits. Expect confrontation. They will challenge your authority. Don't flunk their test. If you give them an inch, they will take three miles. And don't let them run roughshod over people. They need management training but are worth it because they can accomplish a ton of work. Just remember—he is after your job.

**Melancholies** are temperamental people. Make sure they are in the right field. They need constant encouragement that they have worth and are capable, and they usually are. Try not to give them too many things to do at the same time or they will explode, quit, or collapse. He is the one person who may foul up his home-life working too late or taking work home. Help him see that his brand of perfectionism is not necessary to the production of a top-quality product. With proper encouragement and reward he may be with you for life.

**Phlegmatics** are nuts-and-bolts, quiet people who can be depended on if you keep their eyes on the goals. But you must set their goals. By nature they would accept 55 percent of their capability. They work best under pressure but balk at high pressure; so keep it gentle, reasonable, and encouraging. They also need plenty of approval. Sometimes time-study training will be needed to help them make better use of their time. They may never defy you, but don't be surprised if they ignore you. They need constant reminders of productivity.

The thing all managers need to keep in mind is, don't expect other people to do things like you would. They are individuals. They have distinct talents and abilities. Help them function within those capabilities. I have found that most people, particularly Christians, will rise to a challenge if they are treated with love and respect.

## 4. Use it in educating others.

The four-temperament theory is an invaluable tool in educating individuals. One of my criticisms of the monstrous business of education today is that they have ignored the temperaments of children in their teaching process. Educators have made a shambles out of our once great school system with their untested theories that have set the learning process back instead of forward. The gifted melancholy student is a fast-learner who may not need rote learning. But to scrap the rote method for all students is to disregard their temperaments. The sanguine, choleric, or phlegmatic child needs rote learning and disciplined drills to become proficient. Gradually, as the basic principles of math, reading, or history begin to fall into place, he can become a self-starter thinker. Sanguines are restless, temperamental flitters; phlegmatics are daydreamers; and cholerics spin-off on their own tangents. A wise teacher will try to diagnose her pupils' tendencies and motivate them according to need. Sanguines and phlegmatics need prodding; cholerics need goals and knowledge as to why something is relevant; melancholies need exposure to the subject and encouragement. And as we have seen in a previous chapter, each temperament has subject strengths they enjoy and subject weaknesses. If you know his temperament, you can give him the encouragement he needs accordingly.

## 5. Use the temperament theory to resolve personality conflicts.

Some people are so difficult, the Lord himself couldn't get along with them. During his day he clashed with the legalists who refused to believe in him and finally called them "whited sepulchres filled with dead men's bones." But most people with whom we clash are different temperaments; that's why we clash. For example, the melancholy perfectionist is orderly and precise. As such he is destined to clash with the free-spirited casual carelessness of the sanguine. They will irritate each other. The sanguine can get irritated by what he considers the fastidiousness of the melancholy. One great cause of conflict between the two is exactness of language. The sanguine guestimates on figures, mileage, and details, while the melancholy feels it his duty to "correct" the sanguine. No wonder they irritate each other, whether in marriage, business, or church. The melancholy destroys the sanguine's ego by such corrections, so the sanguine lashes out in retaliation with his best weapon—his tongue.

Cholerics have a similar problem. They walk faster, talk faster, and think faster than the laid-back phlegmatic. The relationship of the phlegmatic is both a source of irritation to the choleric and a challenge. The more the choleric tries to motivate the phlegmatic, the more the phlegmatic digs in his heels and stubbornly refuses to move. The hostility such interpersonal contacts can generate is incredible. However, sanguines can irritate cholerics also, but not for the same reasons that irritate the melancholy. But if you want to see an explosion, just watch a sanguine and choleric locked in personality conflict. The two temperaments that seem to have the least conflict are the sanguine and the phlegmatic.

There are two main reasons for personality clashes: (1) temperament conflicts—that is, two individuals that are so different they spontaneously act and react entirely opposite in almost every situation; or (2) we see our weaknesses in someone we love and tend to overreact. This often happens to a parent who clashes with a child who picks up the parent's weaknesses. The first is easier to resolve than the second.

Once you recognize that your conflict with another person is because your temperaments are so opposite, it is easier to accept that difference; you recognize it is not personal but natural. This is the old "equal but different" idea. You can respect the other person's right to be different from yourself without superiority or inferiority being involved. The problem is, many people tend to look down on another's differences. That is where the Spirit-filled life is of great value. When we are filled with love, joy, peace, etc., including "meekness," we will find it easier to accept the erratic or different reactions of others. That is just one step to anticipating them. For example, I have a sanguine friend who used to drive me up the wall with his gross exaggerations. (He calls them embellishments.) I could never count on his facts, estimates, or schedules. Instead of getting irritated all the time, I just began dividing everything he said by four, and then I could realistically anticipate his cost estimates and projections. For my pessimistic friends, I just anticipate their gloom, doom, and despair mentality and work around it. For example, my dentist wanted to tear out my bridge and rework the whole thing. I challenged him to "patch it" and even suggested how. It took a lot of persuasion, but he finally did it against his better judgment saying, "It won't last!" I am now on my third year with that repair job, and he still can't believe it will hold. If you take no for an answer from some people, you will both be the losers for it.

The temperament theory won't solve all personality conflicts, but it can reduce them down to size and make them livable.

## 6. Use the theory to understand the other members of your church boards and committees.

One of the proofs that the local church is divinely inspired and empowered of God is that even democracy, demanded by most church leaders, still hasn't killed it. This is a day when everyone wants to be a part of the decision-making process. If the pastor is a dictator, the people complain that the church is dominated by one man. If it is a deacon-led church with seventy elders or deacons, there will be people who complain it entrusts too much power in the board. I have come to the conclusion that most people complain about any leader if he makes a decision they don't like.

I have worked with church boards for thirty-two years, and I can vouch for the fact that all four temperaments get on any board of seven or more people and usually react according to temperament. I'll never forget the time we were $56,000 in the red during a recession, and the melancholies on the eleven-member Board of Trustees wanted to cut salaries and lay off several staff members. It took all the optimistic persuasion I could muster to talk them into giving me more time, but they finally did—only to find that in seven months we had a small bank balance and had laid off no one. Before I heard about temperaments, I would have to fight harboring a bitter attitude toward such dooms-dayers. Once I recognized their natural tendency, I wrote it off as their temperament and refused to take it personally—or to give in without a fight.

**Sanguine** board members are talkers, not doers or listeners. They need to be given something to do and held accountable. Their talk at board meetings should be limited to their production.

**Cholerics** tend to take over if you give them a chance. But if you have a project of importance you want passed by a board you serve on, I suggest you talk to the cholerics in advance and get them on your team. When the meeting comes, they will carry the ball for you and will intimidate all the dooms-dayers into agreement.

**Melancholies** can be exasperating with their inexhaustible supply of questions. No matter what you bring up, they can think of objections, difficulties, and problems that will be encountered. It has always mystified me that they can always remember illustrations of those who failed trying to do what you suggest, but they can never remember those who succeeded.

**Phlegmatics** are easy to get along with on boards, particularly if you don't expect them to be anything. But if your proposal is going to cost them money, don't count on their support. Always present the cost of a project along with a reasonable plan for repayment, and your phlegmatic friends will go along with you.

Since no board or committee is made up of just one kind of temperament, but usually will have all four represented, you will find life as a leader, pastor, or chairman easier if you plan your presentation with all temperaments in mind. Preparation is the name of the game. But don't forget to pray. That's where the real power comes from.

## 7. Use the temperament theory in parenting.

Every child is different not only in size, shape, looks, and intelligence, but in temperament blend. For that reason, you will find the temperament theory a helpful tool in parenting, particularly in the way you discipline. We have one child that I only gave two spankings during her entire childhood, and yet she is an unspoiled young woman today. The other three children? I won't estimate the times we went to the woodshed. What made the difference? Their temperaments.

**Sanguine** children are the easiest to love. They are born charmers, and if you aren't careful they will charm you out of obedience. Such children grow up to lie, cheat, and in some cases steal. Sanguines need love, but even more they need discipline. And don't let them sass you or they will learn to be disrespectful toward all adults.

**Choleric** children usually take more spankings to raise than any other type. And they can be willful! You must break their will, but be careful you don't break their spirit. How do you keep from breaking their spirit while you mold their will? By being loving and cultivating a close relationship while at the same time you demand obedience. They will test you—don't fail their test.

**Melancholy** children need love and security, while at the same time they need to learn self-sufficiency. They usually don't require a great deal of physical discipline, but will respond to a soft word of displeasure. One trait you must watch is criticism and a negative spirit, particularly if their secondary temperament is choleric. A MelChlor can be both negative and willful. Melancholy children need lots of parental reassurance that they do have worth and value—and that is what parents are for.

**Phlegmatic** children are easy to raise, particularly if you don't care if they never amount to anything in life. They don't cause trouble and rarely sass you back; they just live in their fantasy world of daydreams and function up to 60 percent of their potential—unless you prod them along. It is important to cultivate their curiosity level when they are very young. This is the one child that should rarely be kept in a playpen, for it is those early years, according to the experts, that ignite or stifle a child's curiosity, depending on whether he is free to inquire or confide. Like all children, they thrive on affection and do their best when gently but consistently pressured.

Child-training is almost a full-time vocation in the early years when a child needs what psychiatrist Harold Voth calls "mother constancy." That is why God gave children two parents—so one can be with them in those most formative years of life. Today's emphasis on working mothers (whether it is necessary or not) is destined to create a whole generation of rebellious or insecure young people. You don't have to be perfect or an expert parent to be a good parent, but parenting must be high on your priority list when your children are under ten. Ideally they will have one parent at home until they start working or playing sports after school.

# PART FOUR: TEMPERAMENT AND YOUR EMOTIONS

## CHAPTER NINE: How to Deal with Fear and Anger

“What you are emotionally is what you are!” may be too strong a statement to be true, but it’s close. We are all such emotional creatures that our emotions can influence every area of our lives—for good or bad. I have noticed that whenever our emotions conflict for a length of time with any other area of our being, they eventually triumph.

Consider the power of emotion to influence the other three most important areas of life—mind, will, and body. No matter how intelligent a person is, when he gets emotionally upset he cannot think in an orderly fashion. Emotions can break his concentration and stifle his creativity. Some people’s minds are totally dominated by their emotions. I well recall a professional scholar who had achieved world recognition at the age of twenty-seven. But his bad marriage kept him so distraught, fluctuating between anger and depression, that he squandered his potential and retired with less prestige and position than he had at twenty-seven.

Everyone has had the experience of letting their emotions impair their judgment. How often have you asked, “Why did I buy that car, house, dress, etc.?” You knew better, but you did it anyway. You made an emotional decision. I wish I had a dollar for all the people who asked, “Why did I marry him? We have nothing in common.” Now you can see why I say all emotionally made decisions are bad decisions. The good life is one in which your mind controls your emotions, never vice versa.

The same, however, is true of your will. I don’t care how strong-willed you are, if conflict between your will and your emotions lasts long enough, your emotions will win. That’s why the Bible tells us to “flee youthful lusts” and sins. Our emotions are particularly powerful between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four. That is why the devil uses society, education, drugs, friends, and amusements on our young people during those years. He knows how vulnerable they are to making bad lifetime decisions when they are most emotionally combustible.

Physically it is the same. Doctors tell us that 65-80 percent of all illnesses are emotionally induced. What do they mean by that? Very simply, most people in our country ruin or break down their health long before necessary by indulging bad emotions for long periods of time. Good emotions seem to have a healthful effect on us; bad emotions destroy us. The Bible says, “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones” (Prov. 17:22, NIV).

### TWO EMOTIONAL CULPRITS

All of us experience many emotions during our lifetime. But in my opinion they all stem from two basic roots—anger and fear.

Fear was the first emotion to surface in the Bible after the fall. Adam said, “I was afraid” because he had disobeyed God. Since then billions have known guilt-induced fears, plus many other forms it takes. Anger caused the first family quarrel, which resulted in murder as you may recall, when Cain became “wroth” (a heart filled with anger) at his brother Abel and killed him.

Throughout the Bible there are literally hundreds of illustrations of the harmful effects of fear and anger. And there are hundreds of biblical admonitions to “fear not,” “let not your heart be troubled,” and “cease from anger.” God knew that fear and anger feed on all mankind, working relentlessly toward our destruction or limiting our potential. Additionally, the Bible offers many antidotes to these two emotional cripplers.

These emotions and actions stem from the basic problem of fear. Some counselors spend too much time dealing with these symptoms rather than the basic cause. I am convinced that if we can help a person overcome his tendency to fear, he will automatically solve these other problems.

Perceptive questioners after my seminars have asked, “Why do you associate the emotions of anger and fear with your teachings on both the four temperaments and marriage and the family?” The answer is, anger and fear in their many forms are the most significant causes of limiting the strengths of a person’s temperament and also are the principal causes of breakdown in marriage and the family.

In addition, I teach that the way to overcome your temperament weaknesses is to be filled with the Spirit. The Bible warns us against quenching the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives through “fear” (1 Thess. 5:16-19) and against “grieving the Spirit” through “anger” (Eph. 4:30-32). Anyone who doesn’t quench the Spirit through fear or grieve the Spirit through anger walks in the Spirit as God commands us all to live (Gal. 5:16-18). For that reason we should examine carefully the relation between our inherited temperament and the emotional sin that so easily besets us.

### THE EMOTIONAL PREDISPOSITIONS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS

There is a sense in which all human beings experience fear and anger. But I have found that most people have a “besetting sin” tendency or what I call a temperament predisposition. That is, certain temperaments have a predisposition toward one emotional sin more than another. Its influence on their lives, of course, will depend on their second temperaments, their background, training, and of course their motivation. (To me, motivation means whether they do or do not have the Holy Spirit in their life to motivate them.)

As a pastor-counselor for many years, I specialized in helping fearful, angry and depressed people. It wasn’t until later, when marital breakdown became so prevalent, even in that church, that I began to specialize in marriage counseling. Anyway, long before I learned anything about the four temperaments, I realized that the two cripplers of my counselees were fear and anger. It got so that before I opened my counseling room door and found a man or woman to be counseled, I knew in advance they were either fearful or angry. The only exceptions to that rule were those few people I met who had both problems.

When I read *Temperament and the Christian Faith* by the Norwegian theologian O. Hallesby, it fell open to me like an overripe melon. I saw that two of the temperaments had a predisposition for fear and two leaned toward anger. In the twenty years since then, I have researched everything I could find on the subject of temperament. I have tested over 6,000 people and studied thousands of counselees. And nothing has occurred to change that first impression. All melancholies and phlegmatics have a fear tendency, and all cholerics and sanguines have an anger tendency. Consider the chart on page 204 and the other emotional problems that stem from these basic emotions.

Fear is the paralyzing emotion that inhibits or restricts normal feelings of love, confidence, and well-being. It triggers negative thought patterns, breeding anxiety, worry, and the other emotions listed, which can multiply like a giant snowball and consume a person’s entire life.

The chart on page 205 is used by permission of Dr. Jay Adams, from his excellent book *Competent to Counsel*. It shows the entire cycle of life activities. Now notice the next diagram which shows fear, worry, and anxiety at the core of a person’s thinking. You can see how it reaches into every area of a person’s life. Fear is not related only to one area of your life, like your vocation or profession. Fear is to your emotions what cancer of the blood is to your body; it invades the total person.

Everyone will face fear the first time he does anything dangerous in life; there is nothing new about that. Everyone is nervous or afraid when facing the trauma of driving a car, motorcycle, or airplane, or diving off a high diving platform, etc. That is normal fear. But those who let their fears inhibit them from attempting whatever they would like to do or should do have crossed the line from normal fears to destructive fears. The key as to which kind of fear it is seems to be whether we let our fears keep us from doing God’s will.

Having acknowledged that everyone experiences fear, worry, and anxiety, it should be pointed out that some people have a greater problem with it than others. And the differences can be detected in early childhood. Watch the children in your next Sunday school program. That can be the most terrifying experience your child will have all year if he has a predisposition toward fear or if the prospect of getting up before a group terrifies him. If singing and giving a speech petrify him, that is fear. Some children, the sanguines and cholerics, love it or at least are not afraid of what others see them do or what others think of them. Not so with the melancholy and the phlegmatic. Those temperaments, since they are afraid to leave their mothers, as children they’re afraid of getting hurt or being abandoned, and as teens they fear rejection by their peers much more acutely than do cholerics and sanguines.

I have pondered a great deal about the difference between the fears of the melancholy and those of the phlegmatic without coming to much of a conclusion. In many ways they are the same fears and have the same ill effects, except that the fears of the melancholy seem more intense and have a more inhibiting influence on him. Phlegmatics let fear inhibit their activities, but they don’t get so upset over the incident. Melancholies who fear flying break out in a cold sweat, can’t eat, and can’t sleep even thinking about it. The phlegmatic just sets his stubborn jaw and says, “I don’t want to go.”

Vocationally, the phlegmatic is extremely security conscious. Whenever an opportunity comes up offering a choice between high pay and security, the phlegmatic will choose security. The melancholy can hardly make the choice. Both are driven by fear. Melancholies rarely change professions—it’s too scary. Phlegmatics are easier to persuade to do something new than melancholies, but the new venture must offer more security than the present position. I suspect that one reason so many melancholies spend their lifetime in academic pursuits is because they feel secure there, having spent eighteen or so of their first twenty-three years of life there. (Admittedly, they are highly intelligent also.)

The fears of the melancholy that make him insecure about himself are also more intense than those of a phlegmatic. Somehow, even though the mild-mannered phlegmatic has a difficult time feeling capable enough to aggressively pursue something he wants or needs, his fear is not as intense as the melancholy who rejects himself and his abilities. Melancholies seem more self-centered than phlegmatics, so that compounds their fears. A self-centered person worries about everything, even his worry. One melancholy woman told me, “I suppose you noticed that I didn’t take communion today. It was because I confessed all my sins, but I’m afraid there must be one or two sins I forgot.” While we may admire her spiritual consciousness, we are appalled at her fears of displeasing God. No wonder these people are so sad. “An anxious heart weighs a man down” (Prov. 12:25, NIV).

Even the “fear of the Lord” becomes a pathetic fear—to such an extent that it can interfere with love for God. The Bible mentions hundreds of times that the righteous should “fear the Lord.” That is not the same fear as worry, anxiety, and dread. You can’t love someone you feel that way about. The word for “fear” as an attitude toward God means “revere, reverence, and special honor.” The only people that should “fear” (dread) God are those who disobey him. If we love him, we obey him; and if we obey him, it is because we “revere” or “honor” him. These are not the same thing. Melancholies and some phlegmatics have a difficult time telling the difference, and it tends to cripple their spiritual lives.

The major difference that I can detect between the fears of the melancholy and those of the phlegmatic is that the melancholy’s fears are more intense, last longer, occupy more of his thinking, and inhibit his life more. While the phlegmatic is a worrier and prone to limit himself by his fears, he has a relatively happy outlook on life and can forget his fears as soon as he returns to a more familiar place in life.

### THE RESULTS OF FEAR

Fear is a cruel taskmaster which inhibits every area of one’s life. To those in its grip, fear becomes the most powerful force in their life and it affects everything they do. The following are only part of the expensive toll it extracts.

#### 1. The emotional results of fear.
Every year countless thousands of individuals fall into mental and emotional collapse because of fear. Electric shock treatments and insulin shock treatments are becoming more and more common as forms of treatment to patients suffering from the tyrannical force of fear. Many a fearful person draws into a shell and lets life pass him by, never experiencing the rich things that God has in store for him, simply because he is afraid. The tragedy of it all is that most of the things he fears never happen. A young businessman addressing a sales company somehow came up with the figure that 92 percent of the things people fear will occur never take place. I cannot attest to the accuracy of his figure, but it is obvious in looking at anyone’s life that the overwhelming majority of the things that cause our fear do not take place or are not nearly as severe as we thought they would be.

I counseled a woman who ten years before drove her husband from her because she was so emotionally upset due to fear. She became obsessed with the idea that another woman was going to take her husband away from her, and her emotionally upset mind caused such erratic and abnormal behavior in the home that she herself drove her husband away from her, though the “other woman” never existed.

The emotional cost of fear is very clearly seen in this statement by the late Christian physician Dr. S. I. McMillen: “About nine million Americans suffer from emotional and mental illness. As many hospital beds are filled by the mentally deranged as are occupied by all the medical and surgical patients combined. In fact, one out of every twenty Americans will have a psychotic disturbance severe enough to confine him in a hospital for the insane. Mental disease is indeed the nation’s No. 1 health problem. What does it cost to take care of the patients in our mental hospitals? The annual cost is about one billion dollars. Besides, outside the asylums there are a vast number who do not need confinement but who are incapable of supporting themselves. They work little or not at all and constitute a great burden on the taxpayer.” This cost does not include the heartache and confusion in the families from which these patients are admitted to sanitariums and asylums. Mothers and fathers are left to raise children singlehandedly, and children often go untrained or uncared for as a result of emotional illness of one parent or the other.

#### 2. The social results of fear.
The social results of fear are perhaps the easiest to bear, but it is difficult nonetheless. Fear-dominated individuals do not make enjoyable company. Their pessimistic and complaining spirit causes them to be shunned and avoided, thus further deepening their emotional disturbances. Many otherwise likeable and happy people are scratched off social lists and cause their companions to be equally limited simply because of ungrounded fears.

#### 3. The physical results of fear.
It is almost impossible to overestimate the harmful effects fear can have on one’s physical body. In recent years doctors have called this dangerous cause for many of our physical maladies to our attention. The book that helped put this in perspective for me is *None of These Diseases* by S. I. McMillen. His thrust was essentially that Christians do not have the same incidence of disease that non-Christians do because their emotions are better. I agree if we mean Spirit-controlled Christians. Obviously, a Christian whose emotions are love, joy, and peace is going to be much better off physically than one whose emotions battle fear, worry, and anxiety. The following diagram, reproduced from Dr. McMillen’s book, shows the importance of the emotions to one’s physical condition.

Notice how the emotion center (which the Bible calls “the heart”) is neurologically tied in with all the vital organs of the body. Although the body can sustain an enormous amount of abuse, tension over a long period of time will eventually cause it to break down. Everyone seems to have his own tolerance level. In fact, some think every human being has his own point of least resistance—that is, a point which is most vulnerable to protracted stress. For some, an emotional upset will cause a breakdown in the kidneys, to others it might be their gallbladder, to others their colon or any of the fifty-one diseases listed by Dr. McMillen. Wherever it is, protracted stress caused by fear, worry, or anxiety will find it and the person will experience anything from high blood pressure to heart attacks, from gallstones to arthritis.

The sex drive is a good example of emotional effects on a person’s physical body. Few things are more powerful than the sex drive; yet both men and women can be rendered inoperative sexually by fear. Fear of pregnancy, injury, or discovery can render a normal woman frigid. Fear of rejection or feared inability to perform can make a normal man impotent. Fear feeds on itself and causes physical maladies, which in turn increase one’s fears. It is a vicious circle.

### WHAT CAUSES FEAR?

Because fear is such a universal experience of man and because most of the readers of this book will be parents who can help their children avoid this tendency, I would like to answer this question simply in layman’s terms. There are at least eight causes of fear.

**Temperament predisposition.** The most significant reason people have a problem with fear is because of their inherited temperament. By this time you know which temperaments have the greatest problem with it. In a sense, all people have a predisposition to fear, due to sin in the human race and its subsequent guilt, and also due to the individual’s temperament combination. Depending on the combination, of course, you will have either a strong or weak predisposition toward it. We have seen that MelPhlegs or PhlegMels will have the greatest problem with it. However, even the choleric will have some tendency toward fear by virtue of his identification with the human race, and also his secondary temperament can introduce an element of fear into him. Obviously ChloSans would not be as fear-prone as ChlorMels or ChlorPhlegs, but all temperaments are going to have a tendency toward fear. It’s just that some people have it more than others.

**Childhood experiences may induce fear.** Psychologists and psychiatrists agree that the basic needs of man are love, understanding, and acceptance. The most significant human thing that parents can do for their children, short of leading them to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, is to give them the warmth and security of parental love. This does not exclude discipline or the teaching of submission to standards and principles. In fact, it is far better for a child to learn to adjust to rules and standards in the loving atmosphere of his home than in the cruel world outside. There are, however, two specific parental habits I suggest you diligently avoid:

**(1) Overprotection.** An overprotective parent makes a child self-centered and fearful of the very things happening to him that his parent is afraid will happen. Children quickly learn to read our emotions. Their bodies can far more easily absorb the falls, burns, and shocks of life than their emotions can absorb our becoming tense, upset, or hysterical over these minor experiences. The fearful mother who forbids her son to play football probably does far more harm to his emotional development by her repeated suggestions of fear than the damage done to Junior if his front teeth were knocked out or his leg broken. Legs heal and teeth can be replaced, but it takes a miracle of God to remove the scar tissues of fear from our emotions.

**(2) Domination.** Angry, explosive parents who dominate the lives of their children or who critically pounce upon every failure in their lives often create hesitancy, insecurity, and fear in them. Children need correction, but they need it done in the proper spirit. Whenever we have to point out our children’s mistakes, we should also make it a practice to note their strengths and good points, or at least criticize them in such a way as to let them know that they are still every bit as much the object of our love as they were before.

The more I counsel with people, the more convinced I am that the most devastating blow one human being can inflict upon another is disapproval. The more a person loves us, the more important it is for us to seek some area in his life where we can show our approval. A six-foot, two-inch husband in the midst of marriage counseling said rather proudly, “Pastor, I have never laid a hand on my wife in anger!” As I looked at his timid, cowering, 110-pound wife, I knew by the look in her eye what she was thinking: “Well, I would a thousand times rather that you beat me physically than constantly run me down and club me with disapproval.”

The Spirit-filled parent is inspired through his loving compassionate nature to build others up and to show approval whenever possible. Even in the times of correction he will convey his love. To do otherwise with our children is to leave lasting fear scars on their emotions.

**A traumatic experience.** Child assault or molesting leaves a lasting emotional scar that often carries into adulthood, causing fear concerning the act of marriage. Other tragic experiences in childhood frequently set fear patterns into motion that last throughout life.

During the past few years our family has enjoyed some wonderful occasions water-skiing. The only member of the family that has not tried it is my wife, and she is deathly afraid of the water. I have begged her, encouraged her, and done everything I could to entice her to get over this fear of the water, but to no avail. Finally one summer I gave up. She made a Herculean attempt to overcome this fear by donning a wetsuit that could easily sustain her body in water. She then put on a life jacket, which also by itself could sustain her in water, and very hesitantly lowered herself over the side of the boat. The moment her hand left the security of the boat and she was floating freely in the water, I noted a look of terror in her eyes. For the first time I really understood how frightened she was of the water. Upon questioning her, I found that it all went back to a childhood experience in Missouri when she came within an eyelash of drowning. These experiences leave hidden marks on a person’s emotions that often follow him through life. However, the Holy Spirit is able to overcome the effects of such an experience, as I shall point out a little further on.

**A negative thinking pattern.** A negative thinking pattern or defeatist complex will cause a person to be fearful of attempting any new thing. The moment we start suggesting to ourselves “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t,” we are almost certain of failure. Our mental attitude makes even ordinary tasks difficult to perform when we approach them with a negative thought. Repeated failures or refusal to do what our contemporaries are able to accomplish often causes further breakdown in self-confidence and increases fear. A Christian need never be dominated by this negative habit. By memorizing Philippians 4:13 and seeking the Spirit’s power in applying it, one can gain a positive attitude toward life.

**Anger.** Anger can produce fear. I have counseled with individuals who had indulged bitterness and anger until they erupted in such explosive tirades that they afterward admitted, “I’m afraid of what I might do to my own child.”

**Sin produces fear.** “If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God” (1 John 3:21) is a principle that cannot be violated without producing fear. Every time we sin, our conscience reminds us of our relationship to God. This has often been misconstrued by psychiatrists who blame religion for creating guilt complexes in people which, they say, in turn produces fear. A few years ago our family doctor, who at that time was not a Christian, made the following statement to me: “You ministers, including my saintly old father, do irreparable damage to the emotional life of men by preaching the gospel.” I questioned his reason for such a statement and he said, “I took my internship in a mental institution, and the overwhelming majority of those people had a religious background and were there because of fear induced by guilt complexes.”

The next day I attended a ministers’ meeting where Dr. Clyde Narramore, a Christian psychologist from Los Angeles, gave a lecture on pastoral counseling. During the question period I told him of the previous day’s conversation and asked his opinion. Dr. Narramore instantly replied: “That is not true. People have guilt complexes because they are guilty!” The result of sin is a consciousness of guilt, and guilt causes fear in modern man just as it did to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. A simple remedy for this is to walk in the way of the Lord.

**Lack of faith.** Lack of faith, even in a Christian’s life, can produce fear. I have noticed in counseling that fear caused by lack of faith is basically confined to two common areas.

The first is fear concerning the sins of the past. Because the Christian does not know what the Bible teaches in relationship to confessed sin, he has not come to really believe that God has cleansed him from all sin (1 John 1:9). Some time ago I counseled with a lady who was in such a protracted period of fear that she had sunk into a deep depression. We found that one of her basic problems was that she was still haunted by a sin committed eleven years before. All during this time she had been a Christian, but had gone through a complete emotional collapse, haunted by the fear of that past sin. When I asked if she had confessed that sin in the name of Jesus Christ, she replied, “Oh, yes, many times.” I then gave her a spiritual prescription: to make a Bible study of all Scripture verses that deal with the forgiveness of sins. When she came back into my office two weeks later, she was not the same woman. For the first time in her life she really understood how God regarded her past sin, and when she began to agree with him that it was “remembered no more,” she got over that fear.

A man I counseled who had a similar problem gave me a slightly different answer when I asked, “Have you confessed that sin to Christ?” “Over a thousand times,” was his interesting reply. I told him that was 999 times too many. He should have confessed it once and thanked God 999 times that he had forgiven him for that awful sin. The Word of God is the cure for this problem, because “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Rom. 10:17).

The second area in which people are prone to be fearful because of lack of faith concerns the future. If the devil can’t get them to worry about their past sins, he will seek to get them to worry about God’s provision in the future, and thus keep them from enjoying the riches of God’s blessing today. The psalmist has said, “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it” (Ps. 118:24). People who enjoy life are not dreading tomorrow or worrying about the past; they are living today.

Anyone who thinks about the potential problems and difficulties he might encounter tomorrow will naturally become fearful, unless he has a deep, abiding faith in God’s ability to supply all his needs. My wife shared with me a very beautiful saying she heard which bears repeating: “Satan tries to crush our spirit by getting us to bear tomorrow’s problems with only today’s grace.”

If you are worrying about tomorrow, you can’t possibly enjoy today. The interesting thing is that you can’t give God tomorrow; you can only give him what you have, and you have today. Dr. Cramer quoted a comment by Mr. John Watson in the *Houston Times* which read: “What does your anxiety do? It does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, but it empties today of its strength. It does not make you escape the evil; it makes you unfit to cope with it if it comes.”

**Habit can intensify fear.** Never underestimate the power of habit to intensify any negative force, particularly an emotion such as fear. Anything you do frequently becomes easier to do the next time. A fearful person creates a deeply ingrained habit of responding to every difficult or different circumstance in life with fear. It becomes what psychologists call “a conditioned response.” Each time a certain condition occurs, he becomes fearful. Such conditioning can make people lifetime servants of fear unless the Lord is allowed to come into their lives and empower them so that fear does not rule them for life.

Once a link in this fear chain is broken, it is easier to break it again, and so on until the “conditioned response” is broken completely and a new habit is begun, the facing of that same condition with faith instead of fear. Victory over one fear increases one’s faith to try overcoming others, and a new life cycle based on faith can begin. As we shall see, faith is built one step at a time.

Now I think you are about ready to face the primary cause of fear. The above eight causes of fear are only contributing factors. The basic cause of fear is…

**Selfishness.** As much as we don’t like to face this ugly word, it is a fact nonetheless. We are fearful because we are selfish. Why am I afraid? Because I am interested in self. Why am I embarrassed when I stand before an audience? Because I don’t wish to make a fool of myself. Why am I afraid I will lose my job? Because I am afraid of being a failure in the eyes of my family or not being able to provide my family and myself with the necessities of life. Excuse it if you will, but all fear can be traced basically to the sin of selfishness.

### DON’T BE A TURTLE

A Christian woman went to a Christian psychologist and asked, “Why am I so fearful?” He asked several questions: “When you enter a room, do you feel that everyone is looking at you?” “Yes,” she said. “Do you often have the feeling your slip is showing?” “Yes.” When he discovered she played the piano he asked, “Do you hesitate to volunteer to play the piano at church for fear someone else can do so much better?” “How did you know?” was her reply. “Do you hesitate to entertain others in your home?” Again she said, “Yes.” Then he proceeded to tell her kindly that she was a very selfish young woman. “You are like a turtle,” he said. “You pull into your shell and peek out only as far as necessary. If anyone gets too close, you pop your head back inside your shell for protection. That shell is selfishness. Throw it away, and start thinking more about others and less about yourself.”

The young lady went back to her room in tears. She never thought of herself as selfish, and it crushed her when she was confronted with the awful truth. Fortunately she went to God, and he has gradually cured her of that vicious sin. Today she is truly a “new creature.” She entertains with abandon, has completely thrown off the old “shell,” and consequently enjoys a rich and abundant life.

### WHO WANTS TO BE AN OYSTER?

A similar statement is made by Dr. Maltz in his book *Psycho-Cybernetics*: “One final word about preventing and removing emotional hurts. To live creatively, we must be willing to be a little vulnerable. We must be willing to be hurt a little, if necessary, in creative living. A lot of people need a thicker and tougher emotional skin than they have. But they need only a tough emotional hide or epidermis, not a shell. To trust to love, to open ourselves to emotional communication with other people is to run the risk of being hurt. If we are hurt once, we can do one of two things. We can build a thick protective shell, or scar tissue, to prevent being hurt again, live like an oyster, and not be hurt. Or we can ‘turn the other cheek,’ remain vulnerable and go on living creatively.

“An oyster is never ‘hurt.’ He has a thick shell which protects him from everything. He is isolated. An oyster is secure but not creative. He cannot ‘go after’ what he wants, he must wait for it to come to him. An oyster knows none of the ‘hurts’ of emotional communication with his environment, but neither can an oyster know the joys.”

## CHAPTER TEN: Facing Pressure

“Man is born to trouble [pressure] as surely as sparks fly upward.” (Job 5:7, NIV)

Pressure is a part of life; no one escapes it. We are more conscious of it in this day of jet travel, computers, and frenetic activity than those who lived in farming communities fifty years ago. But no matter where you live or what you do in life you will experience pressure; it is inescapable.

The thing you need to know about pressure is that it isn’t all bad. In fact, in many cases it is good for you. Without it you couldn’t sustain life. Take your blood pressure as an example. If it is too high, it can kill you. But if it is too low the same thing can happen. Life without pressure would be empty and brief. You need pressure to provide not only life itself but motivation, variety, and activity.

In 1982-83 I went through the greatest pressure period of my life. After successfully pastoring churches for thirty years, I felt led of God to resign and launch a national television ministry. Instantly I was in pressure unlike anything I have ever known. I was unfamiliar with the field, had no base from which to operate, and found that television gobbles money faster than the federal government. God marvelously met my needs in those days of incredible pressure and inspired me to write *How to Manage Pressure Before Pressure Manages You*.

In the process I discovered that all temperaments do not face pressure the same way. So I thought it wise in this book on temperament to include the different responses of the temperaments to this universal problem of mankind.

### SPARKY SANGUINE FACING PRESSURE

Sanguines rarely get ulcers; we have already seen that they usually give them to everyone else. Since people are a major cause of pressure and sanguines love to be around people, they are never far from pressure, which usually they helped to create.

These light-hearted people are often very disorganized, generally arrive late for meetings, and are rarely prepared for whatever they are supposed to do. I have watched sanguine song leaders select the songs for an evening service while walking down the aisle of the church. Despite their lack of preparation, they usually do a creditable job because they exude so much charisma. Sanguines are such good actors and people-responders that they often do a better job on the platform than other temperaments who prepare carefully. One can’t help but wonder how effective sanguines could be if they would only learn to plan for whatever lies ahead. Unfortunately, each time they get by with improvising under pressure, they learn that advance planning is not really crucial for success.

This could be the reason why sanguines are often “short-termers.” That is, they run out of material after a time and must move on to their next job. Sanguine preachers, for example, usually stay in a church for only two or three years. Pressure tends to drive them to the golf course rather than to the study.

Because they are prone to be late, undependable, undisciplined, and unprepared, sanguines are never far from pressure. Can you visualize the personable, people-oriented homemaker who welcomes the neighbor in for a “fifteen-minute coffee klatsch,” only to talk too long and discover that the party has ended only minutes before her husband is due home? She furiously whips through the house, trying frantically to set things in order for his arrival. Dinner is late, the house is a mess, and she is not prepared for his sarcastic insults; she lashes out in self-defense about her “overworked schedule” or “the pressures of three small children.” Such reactions do little for a loving relationship.

Sanguines are quick of speech and often use their vocal chords to defend themselves when pressed. More aggressive types learn that in verbally attacking other people they can often intimidate them into submission, so they cover their mistakes by pressuring others. I know one sanguine who reminds me of the Saint Bernard dog we once had who after knocking me down at the front gate and breaking my glasses, put both paws on my shoulders and licked my face. Even though you are right in a disagreement with a sanguine, he will attack you and bluster, and when you leave, you have failed to confront him with the problem. In fact, he has made you feel that it was all your fault for bringing up the matter in the first place. Women sanguines are often screamers. That is, their frustration is never far from the surface, so they scream at their children, husband, neighbor, or whoever is near. Male sanguines tend to talk too loudly, making demands or speaking more dogmatically than their grasp of the facts would allow. If one gives a sanguine enough rope, he will usually hang himself verbally.

One of the most uncomplimentary tendencies of a sanguine under pressure is his difficulty in honestly taking the blame for his mistakes. Because he commands a giant ego, needs the love and admiration of others, and lacks discipline, it is easy for him to pass the buck, blame others for his mistakes, and in some cases lie to get out of a trap. This is why parents of sanguine children need to concentrate on teaching them self-discipline and truth-telling. Otherwise they will develop a flexible conscience.

Some sanguines resort to weepy repentance when confronted with the pressure caused by their unkempt ways. Such repentance is usually short-lived; the sanguine has learned little or nothing from the experience.

Sanguines are easily intimidated by more forceful, cruel personalities. I have seen many highly emotional wives, with tremendous capabilities to love and be loved, become distraught because their husband cold-bloodedly used their quest for self-acceptance to browbeat them into taking the blame for anything that goes wrong. It always pains me to hear a woman cry, “I know it is all my fault,” when that is rarely the case. One woman was intimidated into accepting her husband’s infidelity because he convinced her she was inadequate in bed; actually he acted immorally because he was sinful.

Lying never solves anything. The Bible enjoins us, “Speak every man truth with his neighbor” (Eph. 4:25). It takes sanguines a long time to learn that it is much easier to face those unpleasant pressures of life squarely, take full responsibility for mistakes, and then do two things: (1) solve the present difficulty; and (2) learn from the experience.

Most sanguines cannot endure emotional pressure very long. They will start talking, tell an unrelated joke, or run away from the problem. An example of this occurred in the rental car of a nationally famous minister in January 1980. Twelve of us had breakfast with former President Carter and asked several questions: Why did he not oppose abortion? Why had he endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment in view of the harm it would do to the family? Why did he refuse to support a voluntary school prayer amendment for our public schools? Five of us drove out of the White House grounds in deep silence. I was very depressed by what I had heard, and so were the others. Suddenly the most sanguine of the group split the silence with an unrelated and rather bizarre joke. He was reacting naturally to the emotional pressures that he felt at the moment.

As we have noted, sanguines often give ulcers to others because they will not face their problems and do something constructive about them. A sanguine manager, administrator, or minister, for instance, has an interesting way of trying to solve personal problems. If he senses another’s displeasure, he will tactfully take him out for coffee, lunch, or an evening of entertainment. He will rarely discuss the problem, preferring to use his charismatic charm to disarm his friend’s hostility or displeasure. He leaves that encounter feeling that he has solved his problem, whereas in reality he has only delayed judgment-day for a while. As a husband he will bring home a “peace offering” or “take the family out to dinner” to solve a problem. But as you know, that only relieves the immediate pressure; it does not really change anything. If only he would face issues realistically and do something about them, he would reduce most of his life pressures.

Because sanguines cannot tolerate the discomfort of pressure, they always react in some way—an explosive outburst, tears, jokes, lies, change of subject, or “fellowship.” They cannot suffer pressure in silence. Fortunately their happy disposition easily forgets unpleasant circumstances; the first moving object or person that catches their eye gains their attention, and they mentally or physically separate themselves from the cause of their pressure temporarily. If sanguines could learn to use pressure as motivation toward problem-solving, their lives would be greatly enriched, and I believe they would be 25 to 50 percent more successful in their chosen fields.

### CHOLERICS UNDER PRESSURE

No one can create more pressure than a choleric. He thrives on it—until his body breaks down with ulcers, high blood pressure, heart attack, or other physical adversities.

Some of the choleric’s high pressure quotient is occasioned by his “god complex.” Perhaps it would be better to label it an “omnipotence complex.” Cholerics are always over-involved. They are willing to tackle anything that needs to be done. They never ask, “Why doesn’t someone else do something about this?” To almost any need they respond, “Let’s get organized and put the troops to work!” Then they start barking orders to others.

Cholerics rarely get depressed when a project fails because they have thirty other irons in the fire to keep their overly active minds occupied. Instead of wallowing in self-pity over an insult, failure, or rejection, they busy themselves with their next project.

However, this penchant for taking on more than anyone could possibly accomplish often proves to be the cause of greatest pressures. Cholerics are extremely goal-oriented, but unless their secondary temperament is melancholy, they will not be adept at planning, analyzing, and detailing. In fact, they usually don’t like it. Cholerics are doers. Consequently they may rush into battle before establishing a plan of attack, thus creating a great deal of pressure.

Many of the frenetic activities of the choleric should be put on a back burner. He is successful in the business world, not because his ideas are so well designed, but because he launches them while others are still determining theirs. Some of his better notions die on the drawing board, for a choleric has usually implemented his ideas and projects before he realizes that a better way exists. However, dogged determination stands him in good stead, for he usually finishes what he starts.

The choleric typically responds to pressure by refusing to give up. When he encounters an impossible situation, he glibly retorts, “Nothing is impossible.” A choleric I know contends, “I never take no for an answer unless I hear it eight or ten times.” Even then he is apt to press doggedly onward. Pressure discourages some people, but not the choleric; it simply serves as grist for his mill. Thriving on opposition, in some cases he will clench his teeth and press on regardless. At other times his creative mind will envision a crafty device to achieve his ends. It may not be legal, honest, or fair, but that doesn’t always deter him.

Because of their penchant for adopting excessive loads and their natural inability to delegate responsibility, cholerics tend to take their extra time away from the family. Their ten-hour days soon increase to twelve and fifteen hours, the day off becomes another working day, and vacation time never seems to arrive. Consequently the family suffers.

Interpersonal relationships are not a choleric’s strength, and work pressures compound this. He tends to be impatient with those less motivated than himself, critical and demanding of others, even unappreciative of people when they do well. If he is an employer, he usually experiences a high turnover at his place of business. His family members tend to give him a wide berth. Cruel and unkind by nature, he can be very cutting and sarcastic under pressure. Unless he seeks the help of God and walks in the Spirit, he will be prone to leave many damaged psyches and wounded egos in his wake. One choleric supervisor was reported to be “very productive, but leaves a trail of weepy subordinates.” Gentle spirits should think twice before getting involved with cholerics.

The choleric’s principal weapon is his tongue. No one can use it with greater dexterity and brutality. Because he enjoys pressure, he delights in heaping it upon others. His motto: “We do better under pressure.”

Cholerics need to understand that there is more to life than money, success, or even accomplishment. Jesus said, “Man’s life consists not in the things which he possesses” and “What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” (see Luke 12:15; Matt. 16:26). Mr. and Ms. Pressure-building Choleric may successfully launch projects, develop businesses, and construct churches—all to the benefit of others—but if such endeavors succeed at the expense of their relationship with spouse, children, parents, and others, “What shall it profit?”

In short, a choleric must establish the best priorities for his life and concentrate on them. A man without priorities may become engrossed in activities that may better have been left alone. The choleric needs to set his priorities in this order:
1. God
2. Wife
3. Family
4. Vocation

Then he needs to establish clearly defined goals, rejecting creative ideas that do not contribute to the realization of these goals. He also must develop a love for people, learning to encourage others and become interested in them. His time spent on people will be returned to him multiplied, because others will extend themselves in appreciation, thus relieving him of many of his pressures.

### MARTIN MELANCHOLY UNDER PRESSURE

Like everyone else, melancholies face pressure in life. But because of their sensitive, creative, and perfectionistic ways, everything in life is intensified, especially pressure. Probably no temperament bears more pressure in his heart and mind than does the melancholy. This may be why his mortality rate is approximately seven years lower than that of other types.

We have already seen that one’s mental attitude can increase or decrease realistic pressure. That is bad news for a melancholy. One of his biggest problems in life relates to his mental attitude. A perfectionist by nature, he is extremely negative, critical, and suspicious—as critical of himself as he is of others.

One of a melancholy’s consistent pressures is his desire to do everything perfectly. While commendable to a point, this trait can become maddening to others, for he often spends an inordinate amount of time on trivia or nonessentials at the neglect of more important matters. Sometimes he will neglect one assignment altogether until finishing a lesser project at 110 percent perfection level. Some melancholies cause pressure on their employer because they are perfection-oriented rather than production-oriented; consequently they don’t produce enough to pay for their perfectionist productivity level.

Melancholy housewives and mothers are easily the best housekeepers and cooks. Dinner is always on time. But they may lack gracious flexibility. Woe to the child who tracks mud all over the freshly scrubbed kitchen floor! Or woe to the salesman husband who gets home late for dinner because he had to finalize that “big sale” at quitting time!

The melancholy’s penchant for advance planning can drive the rest of the family off a cliff. Everything should be faithfully worried about! He often creates so much pressure contemplating and designing a vacation that all spontaneity and fun is eliminated.

Melancholies can worry themselves into pressure even when none exists. Most of the things they fear never materialize, but the pressure they build through worry is real. Such unnecessary fears often keep them from venturing out into something new, and as a result they build pressure through boredom, performing the same tasks repeatedly.

Since a melancholy person is predominantly an introvert, he will rarely externalize his pressures by angrily kicking things, swearing, or screaming—at first. His style is to internalize his pressure, comply with what is immediately expected of him, and mull it over until he gets himself so worked up that he lashes out in a manner totally out of character for him—anything from tears to murder. Some of the most vicious crimes committed by people with no criminal records have been accomplished by melancholies under intense pressure. Fortunately, few melancholies react in violence. Most say things of a cutting, hurtful nature for which they are later very repentant. Others ponder the problem and lapse into sulking silence.

Melancholy/cholerics—people who are predominantly melancholy with a secondary temperament of choleric—are the epitome of workaholics. They react to pressure with intensified work. Their choleric suggests new projects, and their melancholy tries to do everything perfectly. Such individuals are often frustrated by “the pressure of not getting anything done.” Others can frustrate them, because they never quite measure up to melancholy perfectionism.

Everyone needs to deal with people by showing concern for them. Melancholies are usually so interested in themselves and their persistent brand of perfectionism that they have little sympathy for and acceptance of other fallible human beings. They would certainly attract more friends if they had more sensitivity. People interested in others never lack for friends.

Everyone needs a diversion—“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!”—but melancholies can become so work-oriented that they eat, sleep, and think work. Vacations make them feel guilty. The pressure of unfinished work makes it impossible for them to enjoy a simple game of golf. They can turn a relaxing walk through the park into a pressure-filled afternoon.

This inability to relax and learn to cope with the everyday pressures of life will ultimately lead to a breakdown emotionally, mentally, or physically. The melancholy’s natural inability to cope with these problems by himself may account for the number of melancholies I have seen come to Christ, dedicate their lives to him, and learn to walk in the Spirit. When they are truly filled with the Spirit, they experience incredible changes that are immediately apparent to all. However, when they regress spiritually, their friends quickly sense the change.

I have great respect for the potential of the person with a predominantly melancholy temperament, but only when he avails himself of the power of God. When he doesn’t, his powerlessness is all too evident.

### EVEN PHLEGMATICS FACE PRESSURE

Phlegmatics detest pressure. In fact, they will do almost anything to avoid it. As we have seen, they do not thrive on controversy, but are peacemakers by nature. Consequently they will always steer around a problem if possible. Unfortunately, ignoring a real problem doesn’t make it disappear.

It is easy to diagnose a sanguine’s reaction to pressure, for he explodes loudly enough for everyone to see. Phlegmatics are different; as very internal people, they do nothing to excess. For this reason you must observe their responses carefully.

Their compulsion to avoid pressure causes many phlegmatics to become gifted procrastinators. This eventually increases their pressures, because tasks must be completed sooner or later and final decisions have to be made. Some phlegmatics use the old dodge, “We need more information,” as an excuse for delaying an unpleasant deed. “Remove the pressure, not the problem” often becomes the phlegmatic way of life.

How well I remember three phlegmatics on a deacon board who appealed for “more time to study the matter” before deciding to expel a leader in the church who had divorced his wife of many years and married another woman. Actually he had made the mistake of marrying the second wife before his divorce was final, and the chapel inadvertently sent his new wedding certificate—signatures, dates, and all—to his home, where Wife #1 opened it. The man was a bigamist! Yet the phlegmatics wanted to delay one more month. Why? They rotated off the board before the next meeting.

Problems seldom vanish with time. Rather, they tend to return more robust and intimidating than before. I have found that it is usually best to solve them when they are still small enough to handle.

The phlegmatic under pressure frequently exhibits one exasperating trait: he flees from the pressured situation. Fathers of rebellious teenagers are likely to sneak out to the garage and putter in their workshop rather than take on their hostile youth. This does nothing for the wife, who laments, “He always leaves the discipline of the children up to me.” Phlegmatic wives and mothers often are weak disciplinarians, not because they fail to recognize their children’s need for discipline, but because they personally dislike the friction generated by confrontation. Many a phlegmatic employee puts up with years of second-rate treatment at work because he does not relish a confrontation with his boss. But “peace at any price” is not really a solution to anything.

Those who have lived with phlegmatics will acknowledge that they are stubborn. This stubbornness invariably surfaces when someone tries to pressure them into doing something they are unwilling to do. Like a burro, they will dig their feet in, arch their back, and stall. If they fill a place of authority, they can be maddening. Experts on trivia themselves, they can think of more reasons why a building permit or license should not be granted than ever occurred to those who made the laws. Have you ever tried to get something approved by the security-conscious inspectors at city hall? It is nothing short of amazing that the free enterprise system has succeeded in the face of phlegmatic foot-dragging.

Married phlegmatics are quite interesting sexually. A sexuality survey of 3,404 people included a question about temperament. I found that male phlegmatics were less promiscuous before marriage, registered less frequency of sex after marriage, and experienced less satisfaction than their female counterparts. Reflecting on this finding for several years while counseling hundreds of couples, I have come to the following conclusions. Phlegmatics are perfectly normal regarding the place of sexual activity in marriage, and they can be as sexually expressive and loving as anyone else. They enjoy tenderness, love, and affection, as long as it is not displayed publicly. However, they do not like pressure, conflict, or rejection; consequently they tend to let their partners lead.

I was surprised to discover from my sex survey that a rather high percentage of phlegmatic wives had indicated promiscuity before marriage. Because by nature they like to please others, they would often succumb to the pressure of an aggressive lover’s advances. Since opposites usually attract, we should note, phlegmatics often find themselves in the company of more aggressive temperaments. Many of these women indicated that their premarital activity had burdened them with years of guilt. (More will be said about temperament and its effect on sexual expression in a later chapter.)

Phlegmatics are apt to blame other people for their mistakes. Adam must have been phlegmatic, for he started it all by complaining to God, “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate” (Gen. 3:12, NASB). This still seems to be the phlegmatic pattern. When phlegmatics are confronted with a mistake, a sin, or an error, they will try to cast the blame onto someone else. It’s not that they want to be deceitful; they just don’t like the pressure of taking the full responsibility for their behavior. Others find this maddening: parents whose children point the finger at other siblings in the family, or the boss whose otherwise loyal, dependable, and careful employee blames a coworker under pressure.

The disadvantage of this trait to the phlegmatic himself is that he seldom learns from his behavior. Because blaming others frees him from the immediate pressure, he goes his cheerful way, not admitting that he needs to improve in this regard. As a result, he tends to repeat his mistakes.

Phlegmatic children are great daydreamers. They escape the nasty now by drifting off into a fantasy land. Some have trouble reading, spelling, or learning math because of this. When they grow up, this mental habit will serve as an escape hatch from unpleasant circumstances. No doubt many unhappily married phlegmatics have endured to the end by letting their minds drift to the Land of Oz. But this is not what the Bible means when it says, “Be content with what you have” or “Learn to be content whatever the circumstances” (see Heb. 13:5; Phil. 4:11, NIV). True contentment comes from God to those who walk with him. Daydreaming can become a form of unproductive phlegmatic escapism.

### SUMMARY

Whatever your temperament, you will face pressure in life. You cannot change that, nor are you responsible for it. But you are responsible for the way you respond to pressure regardless of your temperament. For there is one thing more important than your temperament in relation to how you respond to pressure, and that is your mental attitude. With God’s help you can control your mental attitude.

One of the most important truths I have discovered since becoming a Christian is the need to maintain a thankful attitude—about everything. There are only two kinds of people: gripers and thankers (some identify them as groaners and praisers). Gripers are never happy; thankers always are. You have the capacity to be either, but if you allow the Spirit of God to control your mind, you will be a thanker. We have referred several times in this book to the biblical command to “be filled with the Spirit” (or controlled by the Spirit) (Eph. 5:18). It should be noted that the second result of his “filling” or “control” will be thanksgiving—“always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Eph. 5:20, NIV).

In Psalm 1:1 God warns us against sitting around with gripers. Throughout the Old Testament God denounces and condemns gripers (Israel in the wilderness, Moses, Elijah, Jeremiah, and others). By contrast, in both the Old and New Testaments we read hundreds of challenges to be thankful. First Thessalonians 5:18 makes it clear that anything less is to be out of the will of God: “Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (NIV).

I am convinced that one cannot be lastingly happy or learn how to control pressure unless he develops the mental habit of thanksgiving. And that is not easy. Personally I have to work on it constantly. After all these years of teaching, writing, and trying to practice a thankful mental attitude, one would think it becomes automatic. Not so! I look on the development of a habitual mental attitude of thanksgiving as if it were a large boulder which I consciously push uphill everyday. If I unconsciously forget thanksgiving, the stone rolls back down the hill a few yards, and I must start pushing again. It gets easier only as I walk in the Spirit and try to be grateful by thanking God for his goodness in the things I understand, and by thanking him by faith for what he is going to do in the things I do not understand. Thanksgiving is an imperative in God’s Word. Most Christians consider it an option. Without it you will drift into griping, which will destroy your positive mental attitude and increase your pressures.

Thankful living is a matter of daily developing a mental attitude of thanksgiving. It is not only “the will of God” for your life, but the secret to developing a positive mental attitude, which in turn is the key to controlling pressure. Admittedly, thanksgiving is not an easy habit or way of life to develop, but it is absolutely essential.

Some temperaments find thanksgiving to be easier than others, but I do not read in Scripture that God commands only sanguines and phlegmatics, “In everything give thanks.” This is a universal command to us all, and it must be obeyed. Otherwise our life’s pressures will control us instead of our controlling them.

Anyone who desires to work seriously on developing such a mental attitude should do the following:

*   Do a daily Bible study on all the verses related to thanksgiving. Write down your findings.
*   Memorize one thanksgiving verse per week, starting with 1 Thessalonians 5:18 and Philippians 4:6-7.
*   Read Philippians through daily for thirty days.
*   Make a list of ten characteristics about your spouse (if married) or closest relative or friend (if single), giving thanks for each one daily for three months.
*   Make a list of ten other items for which you are grateful, thanking God for them daily.
*   Do not permit your mind to think negatively, critically, or ungratefully—and never repeat such thoughts verbally. If you do, repent as soon as you realize what you have done, confess it as sin, and replace the thought with something for which you are truly grateful. Then quote one of the thanksgiving verses you have been memorizing.

Without consciously practicing thanksgiving, you will never develop a lasting positive mental attitude.

### LEARN CONTENTMENT

“But godliness with contentment is great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6, NIV).

“Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you’” (Heb. 13:5, NIV).

“I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength” (Phil. 4:11-13, NIV).

The man who popularized contentment “whatever the circumstances” and “in every situation” was the church’s most celebrated jailbird. Paul had been imprisoned many times for faithfully preaching the gospel. Instead of griping and groaning, he had “learned to be content.” How? By practicing the art of praise in a situation that would naturally breed complaints. Our modern jails are luxurious palaces by comparison with the Mamertine prison in Rome where Paul was incarcerated. I have seen it—or one like it—and it was dreadful. Lacking doors, lights, or creature comforts, it was a cold, damp cave with one opening at the top through which the prisoner was lowered. After he was placed inside, only his sparse food supply passed through that opening. Yet Paul had learned to be content.

Your prison may be an overcrowded apartment with more children than bedrooms, an office without windows, a car that barely runs, or a job well beneath your ability and income needs. It may be an unhappy marriage or overly possessive parents. Whatever the privation or predicament, have you learned to be content? If not, you can never gain contentment by moving to a bigger apartment, getting a new job, or leaving your partner. Most people want to change their circumstances as a means to achieving peace. To the contrary, satisfaction is learned by developing a thankful attitude where you are. Your present circumstances may not be Shangri-la, but they are your training ground. Since God wants to teach you contentment, learn your lesson as quickly as possible so he can speed you on to where he wants you to be. I am inclined to believe that many Christians spend their lives in the prison of discontent because they refuse to learn the lesson of satisfaction where they are.

Remaining cheerfully serene in the face of unpleasant circumstances is possible only through developing the art of “thanksgiving living.” Thanking God for your present address in life is the first giant step toward learning contentment.

Learning to be content where you are and learning to develop a godly mental attitude of thanksgiving will reduce life’s pressure down to an enjoyable level—regardless of what temperament you are. Work on it—you’ll be glad you did.

## CHAPTER ELEVEN: Temperament and Depression

When I wrote my book *How to Win over Depression* ten years ago, it was because depression had reached “near epidemic proportions,” according to *Newsweek* magazine, “and suicide was its all too often result.” During that time my travels took me through the Dallas Airport where I picked up a newspaper and read, “Depression—The Leading Cause of College Suicide.” I remember thinking, what would cause a young person in the prime of life (18-23 years) to take his life? The article made it clear—depression.

During this past decade the problem has gotten worse, not better. Today the leading cause of death in junior high school is suicide, and depression is usually the cause. The self-preservation instinct is powerful in human beings, and a person has to be so depressed that he overpowers that instinct before he can take his own life.

You may well ask, “What would cause a fifteen-year-old at the prime of life to deliberately end his life?” The emotional aftermath of a broken home through divorce is one factor, and certainly easy access to harmful drugs is another. It has been my observation, however, that some temperaments have a greater problem with depression than others.

### THE SANGUINE AND DEPRESSION

A sanguine is rarely depressed when in the company of others. He is such a response-oriented person that the sight of another individual usually lifts his spirits and brings a smile to his face. Whatever periods of depression he does experience almost invariably commence when he is alone.

The most pleasant characteristic of a sanguine is his ability to enjoy the present. He does not look back on unhappy experiences in his past, and he never worries about the unknown future. A delightful sanguine friend of mine affords a classic example. While traveling across the country he commented on the many people who approached me for counseling due to depression. Spontaneously he exclaimed, “You know, I’ve never had much trouble with depression; I guess it’s because God has been so good to me. Actually, I can’t remember ever having any real problems or difficulties in life.” His statement really astonished me, for I knew the man well. I was forced to recall that he failed to finish high school until he was almost forty years of age because he ran away from home and joined the Merchant Marines. While in the service he married, and after two children were born, one of them died of a rather strange and rare disease. This caused some bitterness on the part of his wife, who after several unhappy years divorced him and remarried. At the time my friend made his statement, he had been single for six years. Only a sanguine could recollect that type of life and say, “I’ve never really had any problems in life.” But there would be much less depression if all temperaments could think that way.

Many undisciplined sanguines experience depression during the fourth or fifth decade of life. Their lack of discipline and weakness of will has usually made them rather unproductive, much to their own chagrin and self-disappointment. They are also prone to obesity by this time because of their inability to refuse fattening desserts and other delicacies. This lowers their self-esteem and heightens their tendency toward depression. Although they usually go through the motions of responding happily to other people, their tendency toward mild depression will increase. One writer likened them to Peter Pan—they wish never to grow up. Although they are well-liked and attractive, they are often undependable and without real substance.

As these charming sanguines, who usually act like overgrown children, become aware of their own shallowness, their insecurities are heightened. They become defensive, sensitive to slights or criticism, almost obsessed with others’ opinions of them. It is not uncommon for them to become depressed at this point by engaging in self-pity. They may even blame their parents for indulging them so much in childhood that they never developed self-discipline; but it is very difficult for them to blame themselves, confess their sin, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit for the strength of character they so desperately need.

If they do not face their problem realistically and learn to walk in the Spirit, they will fluctuate up and down between depression and happiness for a time until, in some childlike way, they settle for the life of mediocrity which they have brought on themselves, and then go through life fixed in a playful position far beneath their level of potential.

The Spirit-filled sanguine is different! The Holy Spirit not only convicts him of his self-pitying thought-patterns as sin, but guides him to those areas of productivity that make it easier for him to accept and appreciate himself. When a sanguine is filled with the Spirit, like the Apostle Peter in the Book of Acts, he becomes a productive and effective person, untroubled by lasting depression.

### THE CHOLERIC AND DEPRESSION

The hard-driving, steel-willed choleric rarely gets depressed. His active, goal-conscious mind keeps him so motivated that he projects fourteen different programs simultaneously. If one of them proves baffling or frustrating, his disappointment is short-lived and he quickly pursues a fresh challenge. Cholerics are happy when busy, and thus they have little time to be depressed. Their frustration in life is that there are not enough hours in the day to engage in their endless supply of goals and objectives.

The rejection or insults that often set other temperaments off into periods of depression never faze a choleric. He is so thick-skinned, self-sufficient, and independent by nature that he rarely feels the need for other people. Instead of feeling sorry for himself when alone, he spends the time originating new plans.

Emotionally he is the most underdeveloped of all the temperaments. For that reason he usually experiences very slight mood changes. Although he quickly becomes angry, he rarely indulges in self-pity. Instead, he explodes all over everyone else. Because he is so insensitive to others’ opinions of him, he is not vulnerable to depression occasioned by people. If a choleric ever battles depression, it will come as a result of frustration, retreat, or what he considers the incompetence of other people.

By the time a choleric has reached the fourth or fifth decade of life, his activity-prone brain can often create a mental activity syndrome that makes his thoughts cancel or short-circuit each other, much like an overloaded switchboard. As a Christian, the choleric must learn to rest in the Lord and commit his way to him. An indomitable will and a spirit of self-sufficiency often cause him to be a useless, unproductive Christian because he insists on doing everything in the flesh instead of the Spirit. If he does successfully promote Christian activities, his pride makes him spiritually myopic and he fails to discern his carnal motivation.

The peace of the Holy Spirit that passes all understanding will modulate his thinking pattern, causing him to concentrate on the Lord first and then on the task. He must learn that God’s program does not depend on him; rather, he needs to depend on God. He must further recognize that fulfilling the work of God is not enough; he must do it in the power of the Spirit. As the Bible says, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts” (Zech. 4:6). The Apostle Paul, possibly the best illustration of a Spirit-filled choleric used of God, had learned this well, for he said, “… when I am weak, then am I strong” (2 Cor. 12:10).

The flesh-filled choleric Christian can become depressed until he realizes this principle, because he gets frustrated by the lack of spiritual results from his hard-driving, fleshly efforts. Instead of blaming himself for his carnal, self-willed spirit he may swell up in self-pity and withdraw from his church activities. His carnal spirit is often easily discerned by others in the congregation, and thus he may be bypassed when officers are elected. “I don’t understand,” he complains. “Isn’t my hard work sufficient proof of my devotion to Christ?” Happy is the choleric who learns with James to say, “… If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that” (James 4:15). If he seeks the priorities of the will of God through the leading of the Holy Spirit in his life, he will not only be more productive but also more composed. When once he comprehends that walking in the Spirit is the secret to spiritual productivity, he will gain consistency in his Christian life.

Another period of life during which a choleric is vulnerable to depression is retirement. Though he usually does not retire until age seventy or later, he must program into his thinking some added form of productivity or give way to depression.

A former business executive was forced to retire at sixty-five. Within six months he went in to see his pastor in a state of depression. It did not take the minister long to perceive that the unproductive inactivity of retirement was the culprit. In addition, of course, the executive was indulging in the sin of self-pity that laments, “My life is over, the period of my productivity is past. I am no longer good for anything.” The pastor was leading a very dynamic church much in need of a businessman to coordinate and direct the business affairs. He challenged this man to be a $1.00 a year Christian worker. Today that church rates among the most efficient in the nation, and the energetic choleric business manager is thoroughly enjoying his retirement.

The ability of the Holy Spirit to literally transform a choleric tendency toward depression is illustrated superbly in the life of the Apostle Paul. If ever a man was an illustration of choleric temperament it was Saul of Tarsus before he became a Christian. After his conversion, his indomitable choleric will, now directed by the Holy Spirit, surged forward throughout the Book of Acts. His response to confinement offers a classic illustration of depressing circumstances overcome through the invasion of man’s spiritual nature by the Holy Spirit. Confined to the cold, clammy Mamertine Prison in Rome for preaching the gospel, he manifested not one sign of self-pity. Instead, this dynamic Christian took advantage of the opportunity to share his faith personally with every new Roman soldier assigned to him as a guard. Many of these men were converted—“All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household” (Phil. 4:22). In addition, from this prison he penned the prison epistles, including his epistle of joy, the letter to the Philippians, in which he stated, “I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content” (Phil. 4:11). Spirit-filled cholerics will never become depressed.

Contentment is not natural, particularly when you are confined to a prison. Contentment is a learned mental attitude that requires the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit, particularly difficult for a choleric; but it can be learned.

Your prison is doubtless not a cold clammy prison in Rome. It may be a job you detest. It may be an unhappy marriage or a host of other circumstances. But whether it becomes a cause for depression or contentment is up to you. The Bible commands, “Gird up the loins of your mind” (1 Pet. 1:13). In other words, don’t let your mind float along thinking of those things it wants to think about. If you do, it will take your emotions downhill—by thinking of self-pity, or selfish or self-centered thought-patterns. What causes depression? Many things really. If you have a problem in this area you should examine my book *How to Win over Depression*, where I give eleven of the most frequent causes. The most common, however, is the self-pity we indulge in after rejection by someone we love or admire, an insult, or an injury. The real culprit is self-pity. The greater your self-pity, the greater your depression. That’s why Paul challenges all of us to learn contentment—even in the face of rejection, insult, or injury.

Everyone knows what contentment is, or at least they think they do. But few people realize that it is the emotional result of mental thanksgiving—regardless of the prison they’re in. Cholerics are rarely content. But they can “learn,” by learning to be a thanker and a praiser.

### THE MELANCHOLY AND DEPRESSION

Melancholies often are easily depressed because they are perfectionists. Most people could profit by having more perfectionistic tendencies, but the true perfectionist is made miserable by them. In the first place, he measures himself by his own arbitrary standard of perfection and gets discouraged with himself when he falls short of that standard. The fact that his standard is usually so high that neither he nor anyone else could live by it rarely occurs to him. Instead, he insists that his criterion for perfection is “realistic.”

In addition to perfectionism, he also is very conscientious and prides himself on being dependable and accurate. Naturally, all of his friends fall short of this standard, so it is not uncommon for him to become depressed about himself and his associates. Very rigid and inflexible, he finds it difficult to tolerate the slightest deviation from what he considers to be the measure of excellence.

Such perfectionist-prone melancholies can love their children dearly while at the same time becoming depressed by them. Children are notoriously disorganized and unpredictable; they follow their own schedules and insist on acting like children. A rigid melancholy parent finds it difficult to cope with such unpredictability, and consequently may experience depression. Sometimes a melancholy mother may become ambivalent toward her own children, loving them intensely while at the same time being filled with anger and bitterness at them. The carefree, happy-go-lucky little tyke who insists on trekking across the clean kitchen floor with his wet rubbers can be a source of irritation to any mother, particularly to a melancholy. Before she was married, she probably could not retire for the night until her shoes were lined up properly and the bathroom was in perfect order. Children automatically change that, but perfectionists find it difficult to cope with such change; consequently, depression is their outlet. They become angered at the lack of perfection in others and indulge in self-pity because they are the only ones striving for lofty goals. Such thought patterns invariably produce depression.

In fairness to melancholy people, they are as critical of themselves as they are of others. As a result, they tend to develop an inadequate view of themselves. From early childhood they construct a disparaging self-image on the screen of their imagination. As they get older, unlike some of the other temperaments who learn to accept themselves, they tend to reject themselves even more. Consequently their periods of depression increase. If they were permitted to verbalize their criticisms in childhood, they are apt to be verbally critical in adulthood. Each time they indulge in oral criticism, they only embed the spirit of criticism more deeply in their minds; and critics are never happy people!

One day I had an opportunity to see this principle in action. As I submitted to an airport examination before boarding a plane, the security officer began to criticize the individuals who flew on that airline as “slovenly, inconsiderate, disorganized, and ungrateful people.” I took it just about as long as I could, but finally, looking at him with a big smile (I find one can say almost anything if he smiles) I observed, “You must be an unhappy man!” He looked at me rather startled and replied, “Why do you say that?” “Because you’re so critical. I’ve never met a happy person who is a critical person.” After inspecting my baggage, he said, “Thank you, sir, I needed that.” To my amazement he turned to the next customer and said, “Hello, how are you? So glad to have you on our airline.” I don’t know how long he will profit by that experience, but I am certain that he has the capability of making himself happy or miserable in direct proportion to the way in which he thinks and talks to people.

Not only are melancholy people rigid perfectionists and conscientious individuals, but they possess a low threshold of anxiety and tension. The American way of life is not conducive to happiness for such people. We live in a hyperactivity-prone, choleric society, as Dr. Paul Tournier verifies in a chapter on temperament in his book entitled *The Healing of Persons*. It seems that Western civilization, where the gospel of Christ has had its most profound influence, reflects a highly choleric population. This would be characteristic of the Teutonic or Nordic race, whose people tend to represent a high percentage of choleric temperament. Such individuals settled in Scandinavia, Germany, parts of France, Ireland and England, the very countries producing most of the American settlers. Although it would be difficult to prove, it would seem that the most courageous, hearty, and choleric members of Europe came over to settle this country. Consequently, their progeny would include a high level of choleric, activity-prone citizens, which may account for our industrialized, fast-moving, high-pressure environment. Such an atmosphere is not the best for a melancholy, for he is not interested in achieving massive production, but perfection and quality. It is not uncommon to hear a melancholy professional man complain, “We just don’t have time to be accurate anymore.”

This may explain why so many of the hippy or “freak” people drop out of the mainstream of society today. Rejecting its mad pace and witnessing its lack of perfection through the eyes of idealism, they seek a more passive culture. This may be one reason some of them will speak favorably about a governmental system that has totally enslaved people into passivity in contrast to the free enterprise system, which they think has enslaved people to activity.

I have repeatedly observed that many of the young people who have “copped out” of our society are very sensitive, gifted, idealistic young people indulging in escape rather than making an honest attempt to alter society. Dr. Tournier notes that some of the Indian or Oriental cultures place a higher priority on the mystic or passive individual. Thus Mahatma Gandhi, whose fastings were symbolic of passive resistance, became a national hero. By contrast, in the Western world the dynamic, productive choleric is the hero. Whatever its cause, the frantic pace we live in today contributes heavily to the melancholy’s tendency toward depression.

Two characteristics of the melancholy which mutually short-circuit each other are his natural desire to be self-sacrificing and his self-persecution tendency. Unless he is careful, this conflict will likely make a martyr out of him. Ordinarily he chooses the most difficult and trying location to ply his vocation. When others seem to be more successful or gain more renown, instead of facing realistically the fact that he has chosen the path of self-sacrifice, he indulges in self-pity because his journey winds uphill and leads through arduous straits.

The determination of a melancholy to gripe and criticize merely compounds his negative thinking and ultimately brings him to despair. For that reason 1 Thessalonians 5:18 can come to his rescue! If he painstakingly and consistently follows its formula, he will never become depressed. “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”

Although everyone is vulnerable to his own mental thinking pattern, none is more responsive than the melancholy. Among his other creative gifts, he harbors the great ability to suggest images to the screen of his imagination—probably in living color with stereophonic sound. Because melancholies are moody by nature, they may regard their moods as spontaneous, but it has been learned that moods result directly from thinking patterns. If a melancholy guards his thought processes and refuses to indulge in the mental sins of anger, resentment, self-persecution, and self-pity, he will not yield to his predisposition toward depression.

The powerful influence of the mind on our moods can easily be illustrated by an experience I had with my sons when they were growing up. One Sunday night as they were going to bed we reminded them, as millions of children are faithfully reminded by loving parents, “Don’t forget—tomorrow you have to get up early and go to school.” In unison they sang, “Do we have to go to school tomorrow?” Assuring them that this was a necessary part of their lives and accepting their grumbling with customary parental long-suffering, I sent them off to bed. Needless to say, Monday morning they woke up in a sour mood. I sincerely hated to foist them off on their schoolteacher that day.

The next week the same boys were lying in the same bed at night. As I tucked them in I admonished, “Don’t forget—you’ve got to get up early tomorrow because we’re heading for Disneyland!” You can imagine the happy chorus that greeted my announcement. The next morning both boys bolted out of bed excited and expectant, as they anticipated the thrilling trip ahead. As I sat at the breakfast table that morning, I contemplated the difference in moods within just one week. Their metabolism seemed to function better, their eyes were clearer, their faces shinier; the whole world looked better because they reflected an improved mental attitude. The melancholy who recognizes the power of the subconscious mind to influence his moods will seek the power of the Holy Spirit to orient his thinking patterns positively.

It is hard to select one period in life that a melancholy finds more depressing than another. Usually his depressions become apparent in early childhood; unless he is spiritually motivated by the power of God, they tend to follow him all his life. Because he is supersensitive and self-centered, he reads things into every activity, at times becoming almost obsessed with the idea that people don’t like him or that they are laughing at him.

One day the business manager of Christian Heritage College, my wife (who was the registrar), and I were having lunch together in a restaurant. Suddenly a melancholy college-age man with a gaunt look on his face appeared at the edge of our table and asked, “Pardon me, but may I ask you folks if you were laughing at me?” Naturally we were shocked into silence. Finally I explained, “Young man, I don’t think we’ve ever seen you before in our lives.” With that he excused himself and walked away. Reflecting on the incident, we concluded that during our laughter and conversation we must have looked in his direction, which gave that troubled young man the impression that we were laughing at his expense. Equally as substantial are many of the depression-causing events in the life of the average melancholy.

Fortunately for the melancholy, he possesses an unusual creative ability to project all kinds of images on the screen of his imagination. Once he fully realizes that his feelings are the direct result of constructing wholesome mental images of himself and his circumstances, he is well on the road to recovery and prevention of future bouts of depression. Melancholy people risk depression primarily because of the continual misuse of their creative imagination. That is, on the imagination screen of their mind they project negativism, self-pity, helplessness, and despair. Once they realize that their creative suggestions can either work for or against them, they can carefully project only those images that are pleasing to God. Such thoughts will lift their spirits, stabilize their moods, and help them to avoid depression.

Through the years, more melancholy temperaments found their way into my counseling room than any other type. At first I thought it was because I have a magnetic attraction for depression-prone individuals. Later I realized that the creative melancholy has a greater difficulty getting his act together. His creative thought process can find just too many problems and imperfections or conjure up too many imagined rejections, insults, or injuries.

Even more than the choleric, he needs to concentrate on thanksgiving as a way of life. Griping, criticizing, and complaining always have a depressing effect on a person’s mood. If you are going to “learn” contentment and inner peace, it will be through thanksgiving. And interestingly enough, that is the will of God for your life anyway (1 Thess. 5:18)!

### THE PHLEGMATIC AND DEPRESSION

As a general rule, a phlegmatic person is not easily depressed. His unique sense of humor signals a happy outlook on life, and rarely does he reflect much mood fluctuation. It is possible to know a phlegmatic all his life and never see him truly angry, for no matter what the occasion, he tends to mentally excuse the person who has offended, injured, or rejected him. His ability to adjust to unpleasant circumstances is unbelievable to the other three temperaments, which find it easy to gripe or criticize mentally and verbally.

If a phlegmatic ever does experience depression, it is usually aimed at his own lack of aggressiveness. Many times his practical, capable mind devises a suitable plan of action for a given set of circumstances, but because of his passive inclination or his fear of being criticized by others, he keeps it to himself. Consequently, driven by family or other group pressure, he may find himself pursuing a plan inferior to his own. This can produce irritation which, when followed by self-pity, will make him depressed. Fortunately, his depression is short-lived most of the time, for in a brief time one of those amazingly interesting characters called human beings comes along to amuse and entertain him.

At one critical period in life the phlegmatic is most vulnerable to depression. During the fifth or sixth decade he often becomes aware that the other temperaments have passed him by vocationally, spiritually, and in every other way. While he was passively watching the game of life as a spectator, his more aggressive friends were stepping through the doors of opportunity. His security-mindedness has checked him from attending upon daring adventures in life, and thus his existence may seem rather stale to him during this period. If he indulges in self-pity, he will definitely become depressed. Instead of blaming his fear or indolence, he finds it much easier to reproach “society” or “the breaks” or “my luck.” Such a person should learn from the Lord Jesus early in life to attempt great things for God, for Christ said, “According to your faith be it unto you” (Matt. 9:29).

No one is in greater need of external motivation than a phlegmatic. But he often spends his life resisting pressure. Rarely does he take on more than he can do or become over-involved. The only thing I have ever seen a phlegmatic become over-involved in was keeping from getting over-involved. Frankly, he needs to get over-involved. He is the only temperament I say that about. Sanguines take on everything and finish nothing. Cholerics take on everything and wear themselves out doing it. Melancholies take on the most difficult things that others won’t do and ruin their health. Not phlegmatics. They live to a ripe old age protecting themselves. Someone has said, “A phlegmatic is the only type of person who can jam fifty years of living in a 100-year lifetime.” And most of those years will be basically depression-free.

### SUMMARY

You can’t help being the temperament you are. And there is no one temperament that is better than another. Each is unique with its own set of strengths and weaknesses, including the tendency to easy depression or a carefree way of life. But you can control your mental attitude or thinking process. If you inherited a choleric or melancholy temperament it is wise to face it honestly and realize you will have to fight all your life against indulging in self-pity and criticism. If you are a combination of the ChlorMel or MelChlor temperaments, you will have to fight off those thought-patterns particularly hard. But it can be done! With God’s help you can learn to be a thankful, content person, but you will have to work on it all your life.

Every time you find yourself griping in the spirit of your mind, confess it as sin and begin praying to God for who and what he is in the midst of your circumstances. Don’t indulge your natural inclination to self-pity. You will be both out of the will of God and miserable. Make thanksgiving a way of life, and depression will lose its deadly influence on you. “Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thess. 5:18, NIV).

## CHAPTER TWELVE: How to Cope with Anger and Hostility

Fear may be the first emotional problem ever to face the family and it may even afflict more people than the second; but it is not the family’s Number One enemy. That dishonor is reserved for anger, which sometimes takes the form of hostility and wrath.

More wives have been battered, and children abused and psychologically destroyed by the violent outbursts of anger than anyone knows. It is impossible to over-exaggerate the damage this emotion does to the family, marriage, and all other interpersonal relationships.

A pastor friend in northern California called to ask if I would meet with a dedicated couple from his congregation who happened to be in San Diego, trying to work out their marriage problems. This ChlorSan husband and MelPhleg wife had been married seventeen years and acknowledged two problems. First, both admitted, “We cannot communicate.” Second, the wife added, “He turns me off sexually. I am absolutely dead toward him.” Sue’s story was pathetic. Raised in a German immigrant family with five children, her father “ruled the roost with an iron hand.” She lamented, “Mealtimes were always a terror for me, because if Father got upset, he would pound his fist so hard that the dishes and silverware would leap off the table. I always promised myself that I would never marry a man like my father.” When Bill came along, he seemed so sweet and kind that she fell in love with him and they soon married. “Three weeks after our wedding, it happened,” she continued. “Something set him off, and he pounded his fist on the table so hard that the dishes and silverware leaped into the air. As they clattered down onto the table, I thought, I’ve married a man just like my father!”

### ANGER AND FEAR STIFLE COMMUNICATION

Sweethearts rarely have trouble communicating before marriage. In fact, they can talk on the phone by the hour. But to destroy that relationship it only takes the angry action of one to set up a fear reaction in the other. Oh, they usually make up and renew their tenderness and communication, but the damage is done. Each has seen the other in his true light. Consequently, the spirit of free communication will be inhibited. The anger of one builds a formidable block in the wall that obstructs communication. The self-protective reaction of fear keeps the other from expressing himself freely, and thus another block is added to the wall. Gradually such outbursts and reactions build an impenetrable wall until the former lovebirds are not really communicating at all, apprehensive that the anger of one will be ignited or the fear of the other will cause added pain. Tears, silence, and pent-up feelings all play their part, and before long they need counseling because “we can’t communicate anymore.” Lack of communication is not the problem. Anger and fear are the culprits! In this chapter we will examine its results and its remedy.

### PRESSURE DOESN’T MAKE YOUR SPIRIT

Bill defended his actions by saying, “She has no idea of the pressures I’m under, and she takes my outbursts too seriously because of her background. What she doesn’t realize is that all men have to let off steam. I don’t really mean the things I say, but she won’t forgive me when I apologize.” In other words, Bill doesn’t want to change. He expects Sue to live with an angry man just as her mother did.

What Bill didn’t recognize is that pressure does not make your spirit—it merely reveals it. What a man is under pressure is what he is! If you explode under pressure, you are admitting that underneath a carefully constructed facade you are an angry person. Some people have more tolerance and can take more pressure than others, of course, but if you are an angry individual, your weakness will show up sooner or later by the way you act, react, or think. And we all know that the home is potentially the world’s greatest pressure cooker. That is why anger and its various forms of hostility are the family’s Number One problem.

One hostile husband told me, “Well, I have to find someplace where I can be myself.” Yes, he did, and that was his problem—himself. A person at home always reveals his true nature. We can put up a front outside the home, but under the pressures of family living the real individual manifests himself. I have found only one remedy. Let God change the real you so that your hours at home can be pleasant and those who love you most will not be threatened.

### ANGER AND MASCULINITY

Many men seem to have the strange idea that anger is a justifiable masculine trait. “Every man gets angry,” they exclaim. Some would insist that a man who doesn’t have an anger problem isn’t a real man. Nothing could be further from the truth! Man’s natural tendency toward anger has probably started more wars, created more conflict, and ruined more homes than any other universal trait.

Anger seems to be a man’s way of expressing his frustrations, but it is a mistake to deem it a beneficial emotion. In fact, it inhibits sound judgment and thinking. A nineteen-year-old lad who had a fight with his girlfriend backed out of her driveway and “laid a hundred and five feet of scratch” in front of her house. In seven minutes he was dead. His anger robbed him of good judgment as he floor-boarded the gas pedal at ninety-five miles an hour, failed to navigate a freeway curve, and sped straight into eternity. Anger struck again.

Newspapers have been carrying reports lately from hospital emergency wards and welfare agencies that child abuse is alarmingly on the increase. Over 10,000 children died last year due to such mistreatment. What could cause any adult to so abuse a helpless child? Frustration due to anger!

Brokenhearted parents have wept as they related stories of their “abnormal behavior,” registering amazement that they were capable of such action. They aren’t basically “abnormal”; they just never learned to control their anger, and when a sufficient level of frustration was reached, they committed an act which they regretted for life. Such anger-laden behavior is not limited to the lower socioeconomic members of society, although their living conditions may accelerate frustrations. I have seen otherwise respectable people destroy their children through anger.

A minister asked me to counsel his wife for an unrepentant “affair” she was having. Expecting to see a siren walk into my office, I was surprised to find a gracious, soft-spoken woman of forty-five who told her story through her tears. Her husband was a dynamic minister, very successful in his church and admired by everyone. But he had one sin she could not excuse. He was an angry, hostile man whom she considered “over-strict and physically abusive of our three children. He cannot control his anger and has on one occasion beaten our oldest son unconscious.” When the boy reached nineteen, he ran away and joined a hippie group. Brokenheartedly she said, “From that day on I lost all feeling for my husband.”

An extreme situation like that never occurs suddenly. It had been building up for years, primarily related to major disagreements over disciplining the children. She had learned to live with his other angry explosions but could not endure his manhandling of the children. Too fearful to voice her real feelings, she witnessed her husband’s angry frustrations worked out on the heads, faces, and backsides of their children. Although she only interrupted on extreme occasions, she acknowledged “dying a little” each time he abused them. As it turned out, her “affair” was simply retaliation to spite her husband. When the minister came in, he was obviously desperate. I was never sure if he sought help because he really loved his wife or if he was just trying to save his ministry. When confronted with his hostilities, he retorted, “If a man can’t let down and be himself at home, where can he?” I was silent for a long time. As he sat there thinking he finally admitted, “That sounds pretty carnal, doesn’t it?” Before leaving, he realized that his anger was as bad or worse than her adultery. Although this man was able to salvage his marriage, as far as I know he has never regained his son. In all probability, more sons have been alienated from their fathers because of Dad’s anger than anything else. And the tragic part of it is that the son will probably treat his son the same way. Angry fathers produce angry children.

### THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF ANGER

Anger, hostility, or wrath—or, as the Bible calls it, “enmity of heart” or “malice”—is as old as man. Doubtless you recall the first family squabble in recorded history. “Cain was very wroth (angry) and … rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him” (see Gen. 4:5-8). Ever since that tragic day, millions have died prematurely, and countless marriages have broken up because of anger. The number of children subjected to emotional tension in the home due to the anger of adults staggers the mind. Any counselor will acknowledge that most of his emotionally scarred clients are the victims of someone’s anger. It is a nearly universal emotional problem with devastating consequences, particularly in the home. Even as I write this chapter, our local newspaper carries the story of a pro-football player whose wife killed him in his sleep with an eight-inch kitchen knife. Only protracted anger which turned into the white heat of rage would make a person take another’s life.

### TEMPERAMENT AND ANGER

The only temperament that will not have an inherent problem with anger is the phlegmatic. But since no one is 100 percent a phlegmatic, even he will encounter the difficulty to one degree or another, depending on his secondary temperament. As we have seen, a PhlegMel will experience the least problem with it, depending of course on the percentages of his two temperaments. The two temperaments that have the greatest problem with it are the two extremes, as shown on the next chart. Sanguines, you will recall, are instantly eruptive and forgiving, cholerics eruptive and grudging. Melancholies take longer to explode, preferring to mull over self-persecuting thoughts and to harbor revengeful plans until they, too, are capable of unreasonable expressions of wrath.

The gravity of this problem cannot be overestimated! Of the 949 couples I have joyfully united as husband and wife during my years in the ministry, I am happy to say that only two dozen, to my knowledge, have divorced. Perhaps this is because I have asked each couple to make a sacred promise that “before you ever spend a single night separated by duress, you will come to see me.” Except for a few couples whose problem in the early days pertained to sexual difficulties which were resolved in a short period of time, every other couple’s problem was anger!

Anger not only destroys home life but ruins health. A book we mentioned previously, *None of These Diseases*, lists fifty-one illnesses that can be caused by tension produced by anger or fear—including high blood pressure, heart attack, colitis, arthritis, kidney stones, gallbladder troubles, and many others. For years I have quoted Dr. Henry Brandt, who says, “Approximately 97 percent of the cases of bleeding ulcers without organic origin I have dealt with are caused by anger.” At a seminar in Columbus, Ohio, a medical doctor identified himself as an “ulcer specialist” and reported, “I would take issue with Dr. Brandt—it’s more like a hundred percent!” At the same seminar a young doctor who identified himself as an internist informed me, “Yesterday afternoon I treated five patients with serious internal complications. As you were talking, I made a mental note that all five were angry people.”

Doctors have warned us for years that emotionally induced illness accounts for 60-85 percent of all sicknesses today. What they mean is that tension causes illness. Anger, fear, and guilt are the primary causes of tension, and are clearly the major culprits of poor health.

Suppressed anger and bitterness can make a person emotionally upset until he is “not himself.” In this state he often makes decisions that are harmful, wasteful, or embarrassing. We are intensely emotional creatures, designed so by God; but if we permit anger to dominate us, it will squelch the richer emotion of love. Many a man takes his office grudges and irritations home and unconsciously lets this anger curtail what could be a free-flowing expression of love for his wife and children. Instead of enjoying his family and being enjoyed by them, he allows his mind and emotions to mull over the vexations of the day. Life is too short and our moments at home too brief to pay such a price for anger.

Dr. S. I. McMillen makes these interesting statements: “The moment I start hating a man, I become his slave. I can’t enjoy my work any more because he even controls my thoughts. My resentments produce too many stress hormones in my body and I become fatigued after only a few hours’ work. The work I formerly enjoyed is now drudgery. Even vacations cease to give me pleasure … the man I hate hounds me wherever I go. I can’t escape his tyrannical grasp on my mind. When the waiter serves me porterhouse steak with french fries, asparagus, crisp salad, and strawberry shortcake smothered with ice cream, it might as well be stale bread and water. My teeth chew the food and swallow it, but the man I hate will not permit me to enjoy it… the man I hate may be many miles from my bedroom, but more cruel than any slave-driver, he whips my thoughts into such a frenzy that my innerspring mattress becomes a rack of torture.”

So many real-life situations come to mind as I write about the appalling effects of anger that I scarcely know where to begin. I have seen it produce impotence in a twenty-seven-year-old athlete, make normal women frigid, render a twenty-four-year-old physical education teacher incapable of expressing love to her husband, and, in short, annihilate normal love responses. I have visited hundreds of people in hospitals who could have avoided the entire problem had they been relaxed in the spirit instead of being angry. I have even buried many before their time because, like Moses before them, they indulged the secret sin of anger.

In my opinion, the physical damage caused by anger is only exceeded by the spiritual harm it fosters. Anger shortchanges more Christians and makes more spiritual pygmies than any other sin. It has caused more church strife and “turned off” more young converts than anything else. It grieves the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer (see Eph. 4:30-32) and almost destroyed my own health, family, and ministry.

### ANGER IS SIN, SIN, SIN

In two of my previous books (one written ten years ago) I deliberately identified anger as a sin and offered a scriptural remedy that not only changed my own life but has been used by thousands of others to resolve the problem. Since then several writers have taken issue with my premise and tried to justify anger, insisting: “It is natural,” “Anger is universal,” “All anger is not sin,” or, as one indicated, “The person who never consciously feels any anger is emotionally ill.” Some counselors get so agitated that they write lengthy epistles to correct my “misunderstanding of the universal problem of anger.” One man was so irritated that he ended his letter by saying, “You’re wrong! Wrong! Wrong!”

I agree that there is a place for short-term unselfish anger that is not injurious to others and does not involve sin. But such anger is objective, on behalf of others. I am convinced there are two reasons that self-induced anger is sin. (1) The Bible, my base of reference, is extremely clear in condemning anger—over fourteen times; (2) It is essential to accept the sinfulness of anger in order to effect a cure.

Consider these Bible verses carefully.

*   Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. (Ps. 37:8)
*   Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. (Eccles. 7:9)
*   Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. (Prov. 15:17)
*   Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. (Prov. 17:1)
*   It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. (Prov. 21:19)
*   A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. (Prov. 15:18)
*   He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. (Prov. 25:28)
*   Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not let go: Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. (Prov. 22:24-25)
*   He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. (Prov. 16:32)
*   Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. (Prov. 10:12)
*   But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. (Col. 3:8)
*   Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. (James 1:19-20)

Many other verses could further illustrate that God condemns anger in the human heart. In fact, the meaning is so clear and easily understood that I shall resist the temptation to comment on them and simply let the Word of God speak for itself.

The best verses to use if you wish to justify anger are Ephesians 4:26-27— “In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold. (NIV)

Since this is the only biblical text that seems to condone anger, we ought to examine it carefully. It carries two serious qualifications: to be angry (1) without sinning, and (2) without carrying it to the next day.

Qualification 1 forbids any sinful thought or sinful expression of anger. Frankly, people never visit my counseling room with emotional distress from that kind of anger, because “righteous indignation” (which is my label for anger without sin) does not create hang-ups. And qualification 2 obviously demands that this innocent anger not linger past sundown. Those who terminate their anger at sundown will not cultivate emotional problems either. Incidentally, verse 27 suggests that if innocent anger is permitted to burn past sundown, it “gives the devil a foothold.”

The solution to the apparent conflict between the fourteen verses that condemn anger and Ephesians 4:26-27, which seem to condone it, is really quite simple. The Bible permits righteous indignation and condemns all selfishly induced anger. You experience righteous indignation when you see an injustice perpetrated on another. For example, when a bully picks on a child, you feel a surge of emotion (righteous indignation) and go to the aid of the child. You do not sin in this, nor is it difficult to forget such externally induced anger after dark. But when someone rejects, insults, or injures you, that is a different matter. Is your emotion without sin? And do you forget it after dark?

The Lord Jesus’ earthly expressions of anger provide another example. When he drove the money-changers from the temple, his action was impersonal—“You have made my Father’s house a den of thieves” (see Matt. 21:13). His anger at the Pharisees later was kindled because they were spiritual wolves leading the sheep astray, not because they were hurting him. In fact, when his beard was plucked out, or when he was spat upon and nailed to a cross, he showed absolutely no anger. Instead we hear those familiar words, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” Our Lord never showed selfishly induced anger! Why? Because as a human emotion it is always a sin.

Those who use Ephesians 4:26 to justify the human frailty of anger tend to overlook a very important fact. Just five verses further on in that same context we read: Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you. (Eph. 4:31-32)

It is quite clear from all of this that righteous indignation is acceptable, but personally induced sin is wrong. What is the difference? Selfishness! Selfishly induced anger, which is the kind most of us experience and that which causes so much personal and family havoc, is a terrible sin. That is why Scripture says, “Let all bitterness, and [all] wrath, and [all] anger be put away from you.” As we shall see, it is curable, but only after you face it as a sin.

### THE SUBTLE PROBLEMS OF BITTERNESS AND RESENTMENT

A woman once commented, “I never get angry; I just become bitter.” Many others would admit the same about resentment. Let’s understand something very clearly—the Bible condemns all human bitterness, resentment, and indignation. They are just subtle forms of anger.

At a seminar many years ago, Bill Gothard made a statement to the effect that every couple he counseled for marital disharmony had either married without the approval of their parents or had developed a conflict with one or both parents that eventually created conflicts with the couple’s relationship. When a person who had attended the conference shared that thought I remember considering it a bit extreme. Since then, however, the Christian counselor on our church staff, Pastor Gene Huntsman, and I make this question concerning the couple’s relationship to their parents a standard inquiry, and without exception we have found Mr. Gothard’s formula to be correct. People who harbor bitterness and resentment toward a parent, brother, sister, or boss are bound to let it spill over and injure their relationship with others. Resentment and bitterness preserved in the recesses of the mind are like cancer; they grow until they consume the whole person. That is why people who cannot forget an unfortunate childhood, rejection, or injury are invariably miserable people.

One of my favorite secular writers, a plastic surgeon, counselor, and lecturer, has authored three self-help books that have benefited millions. In one of his bestselling books he tells about two counselees with “choking sensations.” One, a middle-aged salesman who suffered from an inferiority complex, occasionally woke up dreaming of being choked to death by his mother. The other was a young father who loved his wife but on two occasions awakened from a dream with his hands clutching her throat with such a resolute grip that he was terrified. The good doctor accurately diagnosed both problems. The salesman hated his mother and even though he had not seen her in years, she filled his thoughts. The young husband hated his father and subconsciously transferred it to his wife. These cases may seem extreme to you, but they are not really unusual, for they demonstrate the natural result of harboring bitterness, resentment, and anger in your heart and mind.

Remember this: bitterness and love cannot burn simultaneously in the same heart. Bitterness indulged for those you hate will destroy your love for those most precious to you.

One of my most pathetic cases concerned a young mother of two who tearfully confessed to feelings of such anger at her infant when he screamed that she sometimes entertained “thoughts of choking him.” She then added, “I’m afraid I will do something harmful to my baby.” Upon questioning, we discovered that she had been rejected by her father and clung to bitter thoughts about that rejection. Her rancorous attitude was eating her up, in spite of the fact that her father had been dead for five years.

### SEVEN STEPS FOR CURING ANGER, BITTERNESS, OR RESENTMENT

Many years ago, after over thirty years of being an angry, hostile ChlorSan, I had a life-changing experience with God. Gradually my anger responses lessened from “most of the time” to “only occasionally.” Today they are so infrequent that I enjoy an inner peace I wouldn’t trade for that old hostile way of life, even for the youth it possessed. Since then I have shared the following remedy with thousands of people, many of whom will testify that it has changed their lives. It may not seem “scientific” to some, but I like it for two reasons: it is biblical, and it works.

1. **Face your anger as sin!** The giant step in overcoming anger is to face it squarely as sin. The minute you try to justify it, explain it, or blame someone else, you are incurable. I have never known anyone to have victory over a problem unless he was convinced it was wrong! That is particularly true of anger. If you have any question at this point, then just reread the Scriptures on anger is sin sin sin and consider the commands you find there.

2. **Confess every angry thought or deed as soon as it occurs.** This is a giant step too. First John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” Inwardly I groaned as I read the advice which the plastic surgeon prescribed for the two men who came to him with anger-induced emotional problems. Essentially, he urged them to replace their hateful thoughts by concentrating on some successful or happy experience in life. I remember asking, “But what does that do for guilt?” Absolutely nothing! The blood of Jesus Christ alone, which is adequate to cleanse us from all sin, is available to all who call upon him in faith.

3. **Ask God to take away this angry thought-pattern.** First John 5:14-15 assures us that if we ask anything according to the will of God, he not only hears us but also answers our requests. Since we know it is not God’s will that we be angry, we can be assured of victory if we ask him to take away the habit. Although secular man may remain a slave to habit, the Christian need not. We are admittedly victims of habit but we need not become addicted to patterns of conformity when we have at our disposal the power of the Spirit of God.

4. **Forgive the person who has caused your anger.** Ephesians 4:32 instructs us to forgive “one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.” If a parent, person, or “thing” in your life occupies much of your thinking, make a special point of formally uttering a prayer of forgiveness aloud to God. Each time the hostile thoughts return, follow the same procedure. Gradually your forgiveness will become a fact, and you will turn your thoughts to positive things.

A charming illustration of this came to me after a seminar for missionaries in South America. A lovely missionary had been plagued with anger problems that almost kept her from being accepted by her board. A Christian psychologist challenged her that she must forgive her father, but she replied, “I can’t.” He said, “You mean you won’t! If you don’t forgive him, your hatred will destroy you.” So in his office she prayed, “Dear Heavenly Father, I do want to forgive my father. Please help me.” She acknowledged having to pray that prayer several times, but finally victory came and with it the peace of God. She is a well-balanced and productive woman today because she forgave. You cannot carry a grudge toward anyone you forgive!

5. **Formally give thanks for anything that “bothers” you.** The will of God for all Christians is that “in every thing give thanks …” (1 Thess. 5:18). Thanksgiving is therapeutic and helpful, particularly in anger reduction. You will not be angry or depressed if in every insult, rejection, or injury you give thanks. Admittedly that may be difficult at times, but it is possible. God has promised never to burden you with anything you cannot bear (1 Cor. 10:13). Naturally, at times such thanksgiving will have to be done by faith, but God will even provide that necessary faith. Learn the art of praying with thanksgiving.

6. **Concentrate on thinking positive thoughts that include love for others—including the former object of your wrath.** The human mind cannot tolerate a vacuum; it always has to dwell on something. Make sure you concentrate on what the Scripture approves, such as things that are “… true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report … virtue [and] praise” (Phil. 4:8). People with such positive thoughts are not plagued by anger, hostility, or wrath. It is essentially a matter of subjecting every thought to the obedience of Christ. Anger is a habit—a temperament-induced, sinful habit—ignited through the years by unpleasant distresses and circumstances that can control a person every bit as tenaciously as heroin or cocaine, making him react inwardly or outwardly in a selfish, sinful manner. Unless you let the power of God within you change your thinking patterns, your condition will gradually ruin your health, mind, business, family, or spiritual maturity. In addition, it grieves the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30), robbing you of the abundant life which Jesus Christ wants to give you.

7. **Repeat the above formula each time you are angry.** Of the hundreds who claim that this simple formula has helped them, none has indicated that it happened overnight. In my case, I had over thirty years of practice at being angry. Fortunately, it didn’t take that long to gain victory.

### IT REALLY WORKS

One reason God has given me the opportunity to minister to so many angry people is because I know where they are coming from. First Corinthians 1:3-4 tells us we can comfort others with the same comfort God has used in comforting us. Basically what that means is that we can minister to others in the same areas we have been ministered to. That doesn’t mean we can’t minister in areas we have never experienced, because when you help people with the Word of God you are using truth, and truth works no matter who uses it. But it seems God often uses us in a special way with those who have similar troubles as those in which he ministered to us.

Although I am not proud of it, I must confess that in the early years of my ministry, I was a dedicated, hard-driving choleric minister with an anger problem. God met me in a very personal way at a conference where my dear friend, Dr. Henry Brandt, was speaking on anger. That experience changed my life. The Holy Spirit brought in a new peace and joy that transformed my habit of anger, bitterness, and wrath. It didn’t happen overnight. It started that day by facing anger as a sin and was followed by many applications of the formula. I have found that anger destroys peace; confessing the sin restores it. The first day I must have used the formula fifty times. The next day it was only forty-nine times. But gradually the habit pattern of anger began to diminish and I became a new man. Today some of the things that used to enrage me only serve to make me laugh. I can’t say I never get angry; after all, I still have the same predisposition to anger I’ve always had. But the expressions are so less frequent I wouldn’t go back to that old way of life for anything in this world. And very honestly, my wife agrees. We both know that the most enriching thing to happen to our marriage in over thirty years was when God’s Spirit began a special new work on my natural anger. I would never trade love, joy, and peace for anger, bitterness and wrath. Anger never did anything positive to a marriage, but the Holy Spirit’s love, joy, and peace really do.

### IT WORKS FOR ALL AGES

A seventy-year-old man came to me after a seminar in his church and said, “Dr. LaHaye, I should have heard your message on anger over forty years ago. I have been an angry man all my life. Do you think a man seventy years old is too far gone or would your formula work for me?” As I looked into his eyes—I’ll be honest—I really didn’t know. I had only been teaching the formula about two years at that point and my church, counseling, and seminar ministry was mainly with under-fifty types. As I looked at him, I prayed silently, “Lord, what should I tell this man?” I have learned that when you pray that prayer he usually calls Scripture to mind, so I blurted out, “With man this is impossible, but with God nothing is impossible to you!” Then I heard myself say, “My God is able to supply all your needs.” These verses encouraged him, and he walked away to try the formula for himself.

Two years later I was holding meetings in Phoenix, and he and his wife attended. Afterward he came up to give me a “progress report.” He said, “I am a changed man. If you don’t believe it—here, ask my wife.” That is the acid test! For what we are at home is what we are. The smile on her face and the nod of her head made it clear—God the Holy Spirit had given her a new husband. You’re never too old or too far gone to change. God is for you and will give you all the help you need. It’s up to you.

# PART FIVE: TEMPERAMENT IN LOVE AND MARRIAGE

## CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Do Opposites Really Attract?

Self-understanding is only one benefit gained from knowing the theory of the four basic temperaments. In addition, it helps you understand other people, particularly those closest to you. Many a matrimonial battleground is transformed into a neutrality zone when two individuals learn to appreciate their partner’s temperament. When you realize that a person’s actions result from temperament, rather than being a tactic designed to anger or offend you, this conduct is no longer a threat or an affront.

“We are so hopelessly mismatched that we have to get a divorce,” lamented a couple one Tuesday evening in my office. To my question, “Where did you get that idea?” they replied, “We have been to a Christian counseling center which gave us a battery of psychological tests, and that’s the conclusion our counselor came to.” I spontaneously responded, “That is the worst advice I have ever heard given by a Christian. It is unbiblical in your situation and will only compound your problems.” The husband groaned, “Do you mean God wants us to be this miserable the rest of our lives?”

“No,” I replied, “there is a much better way! God is able to give you the grace to adjust to and accept each other’s temperament.” Since they knew nothing about temperament, I proceeded to show them my chart, and before long they could determine the true nature of their completely opposite temperaments. Upon my promise to counsel them, they agreed to cancel their scheduled appointment with an attorney the following Thursday and delay further talk of divorce.

This chapter contains the principles I shared with them. I am convinced that any couple—with God’s help—can understand and accept each other’s temperament, ultimately reaching a perfect adjustment, if they want to.

I proceeded to teach them the four-temperament theory which you have already studied in this book. It was obvious he was a strong choleric with sanguine traits, and she was about equally balanced between phlegmatic and melancholy. That is about as opposite as you can get.

They were quite amazed to find that they were not so different from other married couples and that most people marry opposites. Fascinated by the theory and concerned about their three teen-age children, they agreed to come in for counseling once a week. During that time they began to grow spiritually and rededicated their lives to Christ and today, seventeen years later, are happily married. So happily that when I was in their home socially a few months ago I was impressed that people meeting them today would not believe they had ever had marital problems.

Interestingly enough, they are still opposites, and they will be as long as they live; but they have learned, with God’s help, how to accept and get along with their opposite partner. It hasn’t always been easy, but neither is divorce! I’ve had to go through divorce with many couples, and without exception it has always been worse than they had expected. Even the most friendly divorce I know has produced emotional disturbances in the two children that neither couple anticipated. And in addition to the guilt they bear for the weight they have heaped upon their children, they have to live with the knowledge they disobeyed God’s standard. Now that they are both remarried, they discover they have a new opposite partner with whom they must learn to adjust.

No matter who the couple is and no matter how much they love each other, every couple goes through an “adjustment stage” that experts say lasts about three years. Divorce is three times lower among those married longer than three years. Those first three years are crucial. They often make or break a marriage. And the reason? It is during that period we all discover two things about our partner, (1) they are not perfect, and (2) in the areas where we are opposites, we clash.

The notion that opposites attract each other did not originate with me; it has been around for a long time. World-famous psychologist Dr. Carl Jung believed that opposites not only attract each other, they hold a particular fascination for each other. An article published in *USA Today* (September 15, 1983) reported on a new theory that showed that “thinkers tend to attract feelers,” and that both types need to understand that tendency in their mate. I find that very interesting because sanguines make judgments on feelings (intuitively) while mels and phlegs have to analyze everything before reaching a decision. And these are the groupings that usually attract each other.

### WHY OPPOSITES ATTRACT EACH OTHER

What could be more opposite than male and female? Yet they still attract each other after thousands of years. In fact, the future of the race is dependent on such attraction. Unfortunately, they fail to realize that their physical differences are only symbolic of the many other differences in their natures, the most significant of which are their temperaments.

A negative is never attracted to another negative, and positives repel each other in any field—electricity, chemistry, and particularly temperament. Instead, negatives are attracted to positives and vice versa. I have found that almost universally true of temperaments.

Have you ever wondered what attracts you to other people? Usually it is the subconscious recognition of and appreciation for their strengths—strengths that complement your own weaknesses. Consciously or otherwise, we all wish we could eradicate our particular set of weaknesses, and we blissfully admire the strengths of others. If given enough association with the person who sparks our attraction, we experience one of two things. Either we discover weaknesses in them similar to our own and are understandably turned off by them, or we discover other strengths we are lacking, which translates admiration into love. If other factors are favorable, it is not uncommon for such couples to marry.

Like temperaments rarely cohere. For instance, a sanguine would seldom marry another sanguine, for both are such natural extroverts that they would be competing for the same stage in life, and no one would be sitting in the audience. Sanguines, you see, need an audience to turn them on. Cholerics, on the other hand, make such severe demands on other people that they not only wouldn’t marry each other, they probably would never date—at least not more than once. They would spend all their time arguing about everything and vying for control or authority in their relationship. Two melancholies might marry, but it is very unlikely. Their analytical traits find negative qualities in others, and thus neither would pursue the other. Two phlegmatics would rarely marry, for they would both die of old age before one got up enough steam to propose. Besides, they are so protective of their feelings that they could “go steady” with a person for thirty years before saying or otherwise communicating, “I love you.” One phlegmatic man had courted an exceedingly patient Christian lady for four years. Finally her patience snapped and she asked, “Have you ever thought about our getting married?” He replied, “A time or two.” She countered, “Would you like to?” He then answered, “I think so.” “When?” He responded, “Whenever you would like.” Years later he acknowledged that he had wanted to marry her for two years but was afraid to ask. Can you imagine how long they would have waited if she, too, had been a phlegmatic?

In the Western world, where couples choose their own partners, you will find that generally opposite temperaments attract each other. For a previous book, I surveyed several hundred couples who understood the temperaments and fed their responses into a computer. Less than .4 percent indicated that they matched the temperament of their spouses. Ordinarily I found that sanguines were attracted to melancholies and cholerics to phlegmatics, although that is by no means universal.

Sanguines, who tend to be disorganized and undisciplined themselves, are apt to admire careful, consistent, and detail-conscious melancholies. The latter, in turn, favor outgoing, uninhibited individuals who compensate for the introvert’s rigidity and aloofness. The hard-driving choleric is often attracted to the peaceful, unexcited phlegmatic, who in turn admires Rocky’s dynamic drive.

After the honeymoon, the problems from this kind of selection begin to surface. Sparky Sanguine is not just warm, friendly, and uninhibited, but forgetful, disorganized, and very undependable. Besides, he gets quite irate if his lady love, a melancholy, asks him to pick up his clothes, put away his tools, or come home on time. Somehow Rocky Choleric’s before-marriage “dynamic personality” turns into anger, cruelty, sarcasm, and bullheadedness after marriage. Martin Melancholy’s gentleness and well-structured life-style becomes nit-picky and impossible to please after marriage. Philip Phlegmatic’s cool, calm, and peaceful ways often seem lazy, unmotivated, and stubborn afterwards.

Learning to adapt to your partner’s weaknesses while strengthening your own is known as “adjustment in marriage.” Hopefully, it will comfort you to know that no matter who you marry or what temperament you select, you will have to endure this adjustment process to some degree. Additional encouragement will be found in the fact that God, by his Holy Spirit, has given you ample resources to make a salutary adjustment.

I am not suggesting that single people look for a person that is opposite for a mate. What’s wrong with marrying for love, in the will of God, of course? Actually, I know several happily married couples that are very similar in their temperament. For example, one couple we know well are both introverts. She is a PhlegChlor and he is a MelPhleg. Because of his walk with God, he is a happy, well-adjusted person. And most of their friends think they are alike, but they aren’t. I also know a pair of extroverts who married. She is a ChlorMel, and he is a SanMel. Theirs was a stormy household for a time because both were volatile and clashed a great deal until they learned about temperament.

One of the reasons I favor long courtships is because they usually give a couple time to expose the weaknesses of their temperament to their proposed partner. Another reason is that it allows for explosions like those they will encounter in marriage to reveal themselves. However, the couples that come to me “hopelessly mismatched” are already married to a person who thinks differently, feels differently, and responds differently than themselves. Some of these differences are just the natural difference of the sexes. In spite of what the feminists say, men and women are different.

Personally, I don’t believe there are any “hopeless” cases with God. You show me two people who are willing to trust God and obey his rules for interpersonal behavior, and I will show you a couple that has learned to be happy in marriage. It isn’t easy, but it certainly is an improvement over the disharmony experienced in many families today.

Through the years I have developed a series of steps these couples need to take to rekindle their love. If these steps are followed, any couple can have happiness.

God is the author of marriage. He intended that it be the happiest, most fulfilling experience in a person’s life. And millions have found it so long before anyone had discovered temperament. Now that we have this theory to assist us, the adjustment to a happy marriage should be every couple’s goal. And these steps to temperament adjustment will help.

1. **Slam the divorce door.** Easy divorce has done nothing to help the longevity of marriage. In the state of California I warned our leaders that if they reduced the waiting period for a divorce decree from one year to six months it would double the divorce rate in ten years. I was wrong; we doubled it in seven years.

I have found that as long as the divorce door remains open, it retards the adjustment to a happy marriage. And if you are a Christian, it is not a legitimate option for you. God has made it clear in his Word that you are wed for life. So acknowledge that and close that door. Never use it as a threat to your spouse, or even entertain it as an option in your mind, for if you do Satan will entice you with the idea every time you experience pressure and unhappiness. By slamming that door in your mind, you open yourself fully to the resources of God to bring the sparkle of love back into your relationship.

2. **Admit to yourself that you are not perfect.** Humility is the best possible base for establishing any relationship between two people. That is true particularly of marriage because the couple spends so much time together. True love for another person is built on humility.

A healthy look at your own temperament will enable you to recognize that you have not brought only strengths into your marriage and that God is not finished with you yet. He is strengthening your weaknesses and improving you all the time. In fact, you probably have a long way to go. Realistically facing the fact will help you accept step three.

3. **Accept the fact that your partner has weaknesses.** Repeatedly we have discerned through the study of temperament and temperament blends that all human beings reflect both strengths and weaknesses. It cannot be otherwise until the resurrection, when we will be made perfect in Christ. The sooner you face the fact that anyone you marry will have weaknesses to which you must adjust, the sooner you can get to the business of adjusting to your partner. Resist all mental fantasies of “If only I had married______!” or “If only I had married another temperament.” That is not a live option, so why not accept your partner’s weaknesses?

4. **Pray for the strengthening of your partner’s weaknesses.** God is in the temperament-modification business. By his Holy Spirit and through his Word, he is able to provide the strengths your partner needs for the improvement of his or her temperament weaknesses. But it will never happen if you are on his or her back all the time. If a temperament weakness produces a consistent pattern of behavior such as tardiness, messiness, legalism, negativism, and so on, it may be advisable to talk lovingly to your partner about it once; but after that, just commit the matter to God. If you take the place of the Holy Spirit in your partner’s conscience, he will never change; but if you remain silent on the issue and love your partner as he is, then the Holy Spirit can get through to him.

The Bible says, “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (James 5:16). As you pray, God will work on your partner.

5. **Apologize when you are wrong.** Everyone makes mistakes! Fortunately, you don’t have to be perfect to be a good person or partner. A mature person is one who knows both his strengths and weaknesses and develops a planned program for overcoming his weaknesses. That presumes you will make mistakes. We must ask, then, Are you mature enough to take full responsibility for what you have done? If in anger you have offended your partner in word or in deed, you need to apologize. God in his grace has given us the example and the means for repairing mistakes and offenses. An apology reaches into another’s heart and mind to remove the root of bitterness that otherwise would fester and grow until it choked your relationship. That is why the Bible exhorts, “Confess your faults one to another…” (James 5:16).

6. **Verbalize your love.** Everyone needs love and will profit from hearing it verbalized frequently. This is particularly true of women, whatever their temperament. I once counseled a brilliant engineer, a father of five, whose wife left him for another man whose salary was one-third her husband’s. After a bit of probing, I learned that he had not expressed his love for ten years. Why? He didn’t think it was necessary. Verbalizing love is not only a necessity for holding a couple together, but an enrichment of their relationship.

After five or ten years of marriage the man is responsible for 80 percent or more of his wife’s self-acceptance. That is more important than most people realize, for if a person doesn’t love and accept himself he will have a very difficult time loving and accepting others. And the best way for a man to help his wife gain self-acceptance is by verbally reassuring her of his acceptance and love. Instead of harping on her weaknesses and beating her down continually, he should comment positively on her strengths. It enriches her self-esteem and motivates her to try harder. Some ill-advised men are afraid of the procedure, thinking it will make her complacent. Just the opposite is true. Women thrive on approval, compliments, and love. Disapproval and humiliation destroy, approval enriches. The man who wants a wife who thinks well of herself can help her become that way.

This is not just psychologically sound advice. More important it is a command. “Husbands, love your wives” occurs four times in Scripture. Once (Eph. 5:26-30) we are commanded to love her as Christ does the church. Such love illustrates the way our Lord reassures the church of his love—through his Word. You know yourself that occasionally you entertain doubts about God, his love, and perhaps his forgiveness. What reassures you? His Word. That is one reason I advise that we all read it daily. But that is the same way you can reassure your wife of your love—by verbalizing it. Giving her jewelry and gifts and providing other thoughtful and tangible expressions of your love is important. But she will never cross beyond the need to hear your “Honey, I love you!” or “Honey, I admire your ability to________” (And wife, neither will he.)

### SUMMARY

We are not today what we once were, nor are we what we will be, particularly if we let God work in our lives. And that person you are married to is not in their final form. Trust God to gradually conform him or her to the image of his Son.

In the meantime learn to be friends, partners, and lovers. That is rarely easy, and for most of us it takes a long time, but with God’s help it can be done. As God and time wear off some of the rough edges of your and your partner’s natures, you will find more pleasure in your relationship than irritations—provided you are not selfish. Nothing destroys like selfishness. Adjusting to another person, particularly one with a temperament opposite your own, is not easy and it is not done quickly. But like anything of real value, it is worth the investment. And someday you will realize you are married to your best friend. That is the ideal marriage.

## CHAPTER FOURTEEN: Temperament and Sexuality

We are all sexual creatures. That is nothing to be ashamed of—we were made so by a holy and loving God. The idea that sex and sexual feelings are evil is a distortion of the devil. History reveals countless individuals who were shipwrecked by refusing to come to grips with their sex drive. Some try to pretend it isn’t there, others abuse it to their own destruction. Like everything else in life, sex has its place and proper function.

The Bible makes it clear that the only place for sexual expression is marriage. History shows the untold human suffering that is caused when that standard is violated. Everything said about our sexuality in this chapter is said in the biblical context of one man and one woman as long as they both live. That is still God’s plan, and it is still the best way for anyone to express his sex drive.

When my wife and I wrote *The Act of Marriage*, it was not popular for ministers to write explicit manuals on sex. But I had been a pastor and family counselor for so many years I knew that sexual inadequacy was one of the basic causes for adultery and divorce among Christians. I had counseled many Christians who had been married from one month to forty-one years who found sex “unpleasant, distasteful” or “the worst part of marriage.” God never intended it to be so.

Think about it a moment. Would a loving God design two human beings to have an experience an average of 125 times a year for fifty years that was “unpleasant” or “ugly”? Hardly! And the Bible is not silent on the subject. Sex in marriage is not just for the propagation of the race; it is for love, communication, oneness, and just plain pleasure. If you do not find lovemaking pleasurable, you need to read *The Act of Marriage*. God has used it in the lives of many people to open up to them a lifetime of enjoyment.

We had two major purposes in mind in writing that book. One was to prepare innocent Christian young people who had kept themselves sexually pure to read one manual that would open the door to a lifetime of meaningful sexual enjoyment when they married. Today, with a million and a half copies in print, it is the one book most often recommended by pastors for the couples they marry to read before and during their honeymoon.

The second reason was to help Christians already married who were not getting all the benefit from this God-designed experience to read one book that could change their attitude, inform them on this delicate subject and answer the many questions they might have on the subject from a Christian perspective.

I saw the “sexual revolution” coming. I knew that although it would never be approved by the Bible-believing church, it would have a great influence on many of the people in our churches. That has happened in our generation. The permissiveness, the overemphasis and near-obsession with sex in our society has destroyed far too many homes even in our churches. I believe the two best safeguards to help a couple keep their sacred wedding vows and maintain sexual purity all through their marriage are: (1) a strong spiritual life, and (2) a healthy, expressive sexual relationship.

Sexual dysfunction or disharmony was said by one researcher to be 90 percent of the cause of the breakdown between divorced couples. That seems high to me, but even if it is only 60 percent we can see how powerful an influence sex is to a marriage. And since we have already established the fact that temperament is the most powerful single factor in influencing all of human behavior, it follows that a person’s temperament will have an extremely powerful influence on a man or woman’s sexual behavior.

Everyone knows that men and women are different sexually—not only from a physical equipment standpoint, but mentally and emotionally. Their appetites are different, and so are their inhibitions. But their different temperaments also have a bearing on their different attitudes, appetites, and requirements. Many writers and sex researchers fail to take into account the influence on a couple’s sexual functions or the drives of their different temperaments. That failure has led to a lot of inaccurate conclusions.

It is wrong to say that “women are sexually less aggressive than men.” For example, sanguine women can be more aggressive than some phlegmatic men. However, much more research is necessary in this area to be definitive. For this chapter, I have made some observations about the differences in the sexual attitudes, appetites, and pleasures of each of the temperaments, both male and female, based on my counseling experiences. These observations will have to suffice until more complete research is done. But all married people will benefit if they understand the sexual needs and likely responses of their mate. I try to cover them in this chapter. If you are not married, it would probably be best that you skip reading the following.

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Sexual expression is not just a physical experience. It involves emotions, mind, body, mental attitude, temperament, physical fitness, sex education, and other factors. Two identical people of the same sex and temperament can have entirely different sexual capabilities and demands. For example, a melancholy wife, raised by a loving, thoughtful father who welcomed her into his heart anytime she wanted to sit on his lap, is likely to be a warm, affectionate wife who thoroughly enjoys lovemaking. (Incidentally, the best preparation for sex in marriage for a young woman is to have enjoyed a healthy relationship with her father all through life.) If, however, that same young woman has been rejected by her father as a child, she is likely to be frigid. After the wave of libido that encouraged her to marry has subsided and after the novelty of marriage is over (three to nine months for a melancholy), her amour may decline and her frigidity take over. Her response may have nothing to do with her husband’s behavior or personality, and it may have nothing to do with her true love for him. Such women need counseling, patient husbands, and the power of God to overcome such difficulties.

Traumatic experiences can also make a vast difference in the sexual expression of both men and women. Even sanguine men can be warped in their mind and feel insecure if they were molested by a homosexual as a child. Melancholies can be almost rendered impotent by the guilt, shame, and insecurity of such an experience. And we hear all too frequently today of the tragic psychological blocks to sex some women have, caused by child molesters. One choleric woman confessed that she was “totally dead sexually. When my husband makes love to me, I cannot feel a thing; it is as if I am sexually insensitive.” At my probing it was revealed that she had been molested by a stepfather regularly from six years old until she was seventeen years of age and could not gain the maturity to put a stop to it. What caused her insensitivity? Blind rage! She hated that man so much, it killed her capacity to love anyone else. I am happy to say she is perfectly normal today, but it took time and much forgiveness.

Now you see why I say that sex is complex. Like a 125-piece orchestra, it works best when all the instruments are in tune and functioning in unison. If one instrument is out of tune, it won’t have too much ill affect but if a dozen instrumentalists don’t play on cue, it may be terrible. Fortunately, there aren’t that many components to good sexual harmony, but it still is best when all the factors contribute toward the same goal—mutually satisfying expressions of love. Like a great orchestra, great sex takes training and practice. The difference is that in God’s plan sexual training in marriage must be conducted with another person who knows as little about it as you do. That is why the more you know about your partner’s needs in advance, the easier it is to relate to them. It is also essential to maintain open lines of communication between each other, this hastens the training process.

Married couples will find the analysis of the sexual responses of the four temperaments as presented in this chapter very helpful. After you have read them all for both the male and female, you should go back and study the temperament presentation of your partner and your own.

### SPARKY SANGUINE’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Sparky Sanguine is so responsive that it doesn’t take much to “turn him on,” and since he is so obvious about everything he does, his wife is instantly aware of his mood. A natural charmer, he thinks he can turn the head of a female marble statue with his flattery. And he can—unless he is married to her. He usually has a great appetite for everything, including lovemaking.

Most sanguines have very few hangups about sex and usually make it clear they enjoy it. If it isn’t the most important thing in life for them, it’s a close second. The sanguine husband is usually reluctant to take no for an answer; in fact, he can easily be hurt or deflated if his partner does not respond to his gestures of love. He may outwardly project the idea that he is God’s gift to women, but underneath he has a great need for affection. If he is not satisfied at home, Sparky, more than any other temperament, may seek affection elsewhere, for two reasons: (1) the conquest of another woman is necessary to satisfy his powerful ego, and he finds lonely, unfulfilled women easy prey to his charm; (2) he is weak-willed and emotionally excitable; consequently, he is vulnerable to the unscrupulous woman.

The super-sex emphasis of our day is very hard on Sparky, for he is easily stimulated. He has four basic needs in this area: (1) Moral principles deeply ingrained in his heart and mind from childhood that show God’s plan of one man for one woman “so long as they both shall live.” (2) The concept of “walking in the Spirit,” particularly in his thought-life. Romans 13:14 says, “Make not provision (forethought) for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” If a sanguine indulges in immoral “fantasies,” he will soon fan his passions out of control and will commit the sin of adultery to the heartache of his wife and himself. Once the moral barrier is broken, it is easy for him to repeat his sin. Sparky particularly needs to avoid all use of pornographic material whether magazine, movie, or television. He is visually stimulated, and such material is like pouring gasoline on his fire. It artificially stimulates his sex drive. (3) A loving, responsive, affectionate wife who freely lets her husband know how much she enjoys his love and who rarely refuses his desires for sex. Husbands treated like that rarely stray, regardless of their temperament. (4) Sparky Sanguine needs to learn to control his sex drive. He is an instant gratifier in everything, including sex. Many a wife who dearly loves her sanguine husband complains, “He is too quick” or “He doesn’t wait for me” or “He takes too many shortcuts.” Sparky needs to understand women and make a study of lovemaking. Most sanguines assume they know all about it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Good lovemaking is an art that must be learned. And sanguines need to learn to control their sex drive and hold off its expression until the wife is properly prepared.

Sanguines can be romantic, and most women like to be romanced. Sparky needs to control himself to adapt his satisfaction to his wife’s need. The sexually satisfied wife will naturally enjoy sex more and want to engage in it more frequently. All husbands should make a quest of learning the art of bringing their wife to orgasm. This is a safeguard to a long and happy marriage. Sanguines can learn to be good lovers in marriage, but it takes learning, practice, and self-control.

One thing Sparky can do that will enrich his bedroom life is stop his lifetime habit of flirting with other women. He doesn’t mean anything by it (usually), but his melancholy wife is sure to see him; and although it may turn other women on, be sure of this—it is a giant turnoff to his wife. Be friendly, but not flirtatious.

### THE SEXUAL RESPONSE OF MRS. SARAH SANGUINE

Very few differences in sexual response distinguish a sanguine man from a sanguine woman. Sarah Sanguine is a cheerful, happy, affectionate cheerleader-type who has the gift of making men feel “comfortable” in her presence. Her charming personality makes her a “hit” with all types of men, and in her naivete she can turn them on without realizing it. She usually thinks she is “just being friendly.”

As a wife, Sarah has a tremendous amount of love to impart to her husband and family. Lovemaking is very important to her, and it doesn’t usually take too much coaxing to get her into the mood. Even if hurt or angry, she rather easily can moderate her attitude. Sanguines rarely carry a grudge, a trait essential for any marriage. She is the most likely type to greet her husband at the door with a “kiss with a future.” Of all the temperaments, she is the one most likely to jolt her husband, after reading *The Total Woman*, by meeting him at the door dressed in boots and an apron.

Sarah rarely has hangups about anything, so she usually maintains a good attitude toward sex, often in spite of disastrously distorted misconceptions handed down from her mother. Her natural ability to express herself overcomes her inhibitions, and she quickly finds that she heightens her lovemaking enjoyment by being aggressive. Unless unwisely stifled by her husband, she usually learns early that passivity in lovemaking is not for her. Her sanguine moodswings vary, bringing great delight to her partner. These wives have a tremendous desire to please their partners. With a reasonable amount of encouragement and cooperation, they usually succeed in this area of marriage, provided their shortcomings in other areas do not become their partner’s obsessions.

Fun-loving Sarah Sanguines start out in marriage expecting to enjoy sex. The following suggestions will help them to realize that potential:

(1) Cultivate a strong spiritual life by walking in the Spirit, regularly studying the Word of God, and obeying his standards of moral behavior.
(2) Recognize your ability to excite men other than your husband and avoid flirtations that would provoke his jealousy or confront you with unnecessary temptations.
(3) Soften your extroversion so you will not embarrass your husband. A loud, over-bubbly wife may gain the attention of other men, but she is certain to earn the disapproval of her husband.
(4) Sarah needs to concentrate on tenderly loving her mate, who will assure her of his approval and acceptance and dispense tender words of encouragement, attention, and affection. If she receives these, she will give attention to proper grooming, fashion, manners, good housekeeping, and whatever else will make her pleasing to her husband.

Sexually satisfying lovemaking is important to Sarah. She can happily endure almost anything in life if she is not starved for love. And let’s face it—sex is an expression of love. It is a wise husband who does not pander it out for good behavior, but adapts himself to his wife’s needs.

### ROCKY CHOLERIC AS A HUSBAND

On the surface a choleric suitor appears to be a great lover. Candy and flowers in abundance, politeness, kindness, and dynamic leadership make him appear to be the embodiment of manliness. Somehow that tends to change shortly after marriage as he takes the romance out of their marriage.

Cholerics are such goal-conscious creatures that they are willing to do almost anything to attain their desires. Since the “sweet young thing” is subconsciously a goal before marriage, the choleric is willing to pay any price to win her hand. Once married, however, the goal is changed; now he wants to support her properly. Consequently, he may work from twelve to twenty hours a day. The hardest thing for a choleric male to understand is that his partner did not marry him for what he could give her, but for himself. When confronted with his wife’s complaint that he doesn’t love her anymore, he responds, “Of course I love you; I work like a slave to give you what you want.” The truth of the matter is, he enjoys work.

Emotionally, a choleric is an extremist; he is either hot or cold. He can get furiously angry and explode over trifles, and his bride becomes terrified when she first sees these outbursts. His impatience and inability to lavish affection on her may produce a difficult adjustment for her. Showing affection is just “not his thing.” One woman married to a choleric said, “Kissing my husband is like kissing a marble statue in the cemetery on a winter day.”

The choleric’s impetuous traits likewise hinder his proper adjustment to marriage. Just as he is apt to set out on a trip before consulting a road map, he is prone to take his wife to the bedroom without the slightest sex education. Somehow he thinks it will all work out!

Fortunately, a choleric possesses one important trait that helps his love life—he is always practical. Once he realizes that lovemaking involves more than preparing for a 100-yard dash—that he must be tender, gentle, affectionate, thoughtful, and sensitive to his wife’s needs—he learns quickly. In the learning process he finds that affection is exciting and that watching the woman he loves respond to his touch is extremely fulfilling.

The most underdeveloped part of a choleric is his emotional life. And since lovemaking at its best is motivated by emotion, he has many needs:

(1) To show love and compassion for others. Nothing short of the personal experience of receiving Christ as Lord and Savior and learning to “walk in the Spirit” will provide the choleric with this ability. Even after his conversion, it often takes some time before the “love of God” characterizes his life.
(2) To understand that many people are not as self-sufficient as he. Even though they may be as capable, they will not be as confident that they can perform well. Rocky must realize that other people may tend to harbor doubts much more easily than he. If he will patiently show kindness and encourage his partner, she will be a better performer.
(3) To develop tenderness and affection for his wife and children and to voice his approval and commendation of them. He must learn to say “I love you” quite frequently to his wife and act proud of her. Because the choleric is a natural leader, others tend to look to him for approval, love, and acceptance. He can wither them with a disapproving look and condemning word, or he can lift their spirits by going out of his way to approve and commend them. Those who have been rejected by him may tend to build a shell around their egos in order to protect themselves and to ward off future injuries. When the choleric father and husband becomes sensitive to the emotional needs of his family, he can even spark emotions within himself that would otherwise remain dormant. To say, “I love you” is not easy for him; but when he forgets himself, recognizing the importance of these words to his loved one, and concentrates on her emotional well-being, Rocky will learn quickly—and will thoroughly enjoy the response it brings.
(4) Rocky also needs to eliminate sarcasm and disrespectful speech from his vocabulary. Unkind and resentful words never turn a wife on.
(5) To learn to overcome his inner hostilities and anger for two reasons: first, “grieving the Spirit” through anger (Eph. 4:30-32) will keep him a spiritual pygmy all of his Christian life; second, the threat of instant choleric explosion inhibits the emotional expressions of his wife. It is difficult for a choleric Christian to realize that his spiritual life will affect his bedroom life, but it does—one way or the other.

### THE CHOLERIC WIFE’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Clara Choleric is usually an exciting creature, particularly if one does not have to live with her. She is extremely active in every area of life—a dynamic, forceful individual with multiple goals in mind. At the same time, she may feature a spitfire personality and a razor-blade tongue, dominating and controlling every activity in which she is involved.

In my late teens there was such a girl in our youth group. Many guys dated her because she was fun to be with, but they kiddingly remarked behind her back, “Don’t marry Evelyn unless you want to be President of the United States.”

The necessity of having a positive mental attitude toward lovemaking in marriage comes into focus when dealing with the choleric wife. If she observed a warm love relationship between her parents while she was growing up, she will probably enter marriage expecting to enjoy lovemaking. Cholerics usually achieve what they set out to do, and she will probably not be disappointed—nor will her husband.

On the other hand, if she has been raised by unhappy, bickering parents, if she has been molested or has endured other traumatic experiences in childhood, or if she has been taught that “sex is dirty” for either religious or other ill-conceived reasons, she may encounter serious difficulty in relating properly to her husband. Cholerics are so opinionated that once obsessed with the idea that “sex is not for nice girls,” they might reject the angel Gabriel carrying a message on a stone tablet saying “marriage is honorable in all.” But once convinced that God wants her to enjoy sex, she can usually make a quick transition to a happy love life.

Choleric wives often acquire several potential hangups in this department. They are not usually given to open affection, and thus they often stifle their husbands’ advances before their own motor rolls into action. In addition, if not Spirit-filled they tend to demasculinize a man by dominating and leading him in everything—including sex. It takes a Spirit-led, thoughtful choleric woman to recognize that she ignores her husband’s ego at her own peril. We have observed that opposites attract each other in marriage; consequently, a choleric woman will usually select a passive partner. If she isn’t especially fond of lovemaking, they may go for long periods without it because he may be too passive to say or do anything about it. Whether or not he raises the issue, you can be sure he doesn’t enjoy the abstinence! Ultimately an explosion occurs and almost always with serious consequences.

It is to the choleric wife’s credit, however, that she will usually adjust and become a very enjoyable partner once she learns how important a good bedroom life is to her husband. She must realize that the success of her marriage may well depend upon her performance and willingness to let her husband maintain leadership in this intimate area of their life.

Like her male counterpart, Clara Choleric has many needs. These are some of the most important for her to consider:

(1) To “walk in the Spirit” in order to provide victory over her hot temper and sarcastic tongue, and to develop her emotional capability in showing love and affection. Being loving and affectionate is certainly easier for some temperaments than others, but God would never have commanded that we love one another if he had not known it was possible for all. Cholerics may need to work at it a little harder than some, but the more they express it, the easier it comes.
(2) To learn forgiveness—especially for her father, if necessary. No woman can fully enjoy her husband if she hates her father. This is especially true of strong-minded, opinionated, willful cholerics. They will vent their frustrated wrath on their husbands, stifling their expressions of love. One reason a choleric woman may have this problem is that as a little girl she may have resisted her father’s affections; and because he did not understand, he closed her out of his heart and had little to do with her—he simply did not know how to reach her. Not realizing why she was rejected by her daddy, she increasingly withdrew from showing any normal expressions of emotion toward him and fostered a growing resentment toward men.
(3) To avoid heaping sarcasm, criticism, and ridicule on her husband, particularly in the lovemaking area. Cholerics exude so much self-confidence that, even without saying anything, they cause others to feel inadequate. The choleric woman needs to let her husband know how much she values him as a man and a lover. No compliment is sweeter and cherished longer than one which appreciates the masculinity or femininity of one’s partner.
(4) To take time to express love to her husband. Cholerics are often night people. Early-bird husbands may crawl into bed at ten or eleven o’clock, hoping for a little tenderness and love. But they fall asleep while their choleric wives finish a book, clean the house, or pursue countless other activities which their active minds suggest. Many choleric wives could improve their love lives just by going to bed earlier.
(5) To learn submission by biblical standards. A choleric likes to lead and usually makes a good leader, but by the grace of God and in obedience to his Word, such a wife needs to bring herself into submission to her husband. If she attempts to assume the husband’s role and responsibilities in the home, she is courting disaster. A passive husband will give his wife more love, respect, and flexibility if she encourages him to take the responsibility and leadership of their home.

### THE MELANCHOLY HUSBAND’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Marvin Melancholy is a supreme idealist. He usually goes into marriage without any sex education because he idealistically believes that “everything will work out.” If he is blessed with an amorous and exciting wife who has no hangups, everything usually does work out; but if he marries someone as naive as he, they may come home from their honeymoon in a depressed state. When the love life of a couple is deficient it can create a shaky experience for a melancholic husband. His wife will especially be turned off by his depression, further complicating matters. It is usually quite difficult for him to seek counseling until his marriage enters a precarious phase.

The melancholy, more than any other temperament, has the capacity to express true love. He is a loyal and faithful partner unless he overindulges in impure thoughts and becomes involved in pornography. When Marvin Melancholy enjoys a good sex life with his wife, he will almost overextend himself in every other area of their marriage in thoughtfulness, kindness, and emotion.

Among the melancholy’s greatest assets is his romanticism. He does the work of preparation beautifully: soft music, dim lights, perfume—those things that delight the romantic heart of a woman.

Because he is extremely analytical, Martin quickly learns what his wife finds pleasurable and enjoys bringing her fulfillment. If everything goes well for them, this couple can become great lovers.

Melancholies are such perfectionists that they almost refuse to accept anything less than perfection. Many a melancholy man can come home all “revved up” for his wife only to have his ardor cooled by dirty dishes in the sink or kids’ toys in the middle of the floor. In fact, I know one melancholy husband who could be turned on by watching his wife get undressed for bed and turned off because she didn’t hang up her clothes. At a time like that, a sanguine or choleric wouldn’t even notice the clothes!

The sensitive traits of the melancholy that on most occasions make him aware of his wife’s needs for tenderness and love may also work against him at times. He is prone to interpret his wife’s lack of immediate response when he first initiates lovemaking as rejection. If his wife is in a coy mood, as women frequently are, and wants mild pursuit, he is apt to think she doesn’t desire him and gives up before she can reveal her true feelings.

The melancholy individual has a tremendous amount of love to give to others if granted the slightest encouragement. These are some of his most obvious needs:

(1) Maintaining a vital, personal relationship with God, and a daily Spirit-filled experience that keeps him “others-oriented” instead of obsessed with himself. No selfish or self-centered person will be a good lover, no matter what his temperament. A real test of whether or not a melancholy is walking in the Spirit appears when he breaks that self-centered syndrome.
(2) Learning to give unconditional love, not rewarded love. A wife once told me that her husband was a natural-born nitpicker. “He has a long checklist for housekeeping, and if I don’t rate an ‘A’ before we go to bed, he will not make love to me,” she complained.
(3) Avoiding a critical and pessimistic attitude, the two biggest problems of a melancholy. Because of his perfectionism, he often has unrealistic standards of achievement for himself and others. This in turn causes him to become frequently disillusioned when things and people don’t measure up.
(4) Maintaining a positive and wholesome thought life (Phil. 4:8). He should never indulge in revengeful thought patterns of self-pity, but always “in every thing give thanks” (1 Thess. 5:18).
(5) Being married to a woman who is not easily offended and can cheerfully encourage him when he is down, reassure him of his manhood when he is insecure, and take his criticism lightly. As long as she knows he is moody, she can patiently wait a little while for his mood to change.
(6) Concentrating on God and thanking him for his partner’s strengths. He must regularly encourage her with verbal assurances of love and approval. I have seen many a sanguine wife go through a personality change under the constant criticism of a melancholic husband. Unfortunately, when he is finished even Martin Melancholy doesn’t like his creation.

### THE MELANCHOLY WIFE’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Martha Melancholy is an unpredictable love partner, for she has the greatest of all mood swings. On some occasions she can be as exciting and stimulating as any sanguine. On others she has absolutely no interest in anything—including love. She may meet her husband at the door and sweep him off his feet right into the bedroom, or she may ignore his arrival completely.

Martha Melancholy is the supreme romantic, and her moods are as apparent as the noonday sun. When in the mood for love, she resorts to dinner by candlelight, soft music, and heavy perfume. (If she’s married to a sanguine, that works quite well; but if her husband is a choleric, she may be in trouble, because he often detests perfume.)

Although she has the capability of enjoying ecstatic love at heights that would asphyxiate other temperaments, she rarely is interested in setting world records for frequency. To her, quality is always preferable to quantity. Of all the temperament types, she is the most apt to engage in bedroom roulette—that is, she dispenses love as a reward for good behavior. However, no man worthy of the title will put up with that!

A melancholy is often plagued with unreal prudishness, especially if her mother had a problem in this area. She may use trumped-up religious arguments to excuse her sexual abstinence; her real problem, however, probably stems from her premarital resolution that sex is undesirable, and she has never given herself the opportunity to learn otherwise. She is the type who saves lovemaking only for propagation—rarely for pleasure. A study of the Scriptures can teach her differently.

Little things can quickly be turned into mountainous problems for Martha Melancholy. Her husband’s inability to balance the checkbook, his forgetting to run an errand, or his forgetting to bathe may thoroughly upset her and send her into frigid revenge. She feels he didn’t keep his part of a bargain, so she need not keep hers—and thus she refrains from lovemaking. What she doesn’t realize is that she is cheating herself out of both the enjoyment of lovemaking and the loving approval of her husband.

I counseled a melancholic wife who had not made love with her partner for several weeks. She was only interested at night, but by the time she was ready for bed, he had collapsed. She complained, “He goes to bed tired, and he never even takes time to bathe or brush his teeth. In the morning I am a zombie and he is charged up. But I can’t stand his body smells and bad breath then!” I suggested that she learn to accept her husband and not try to change him. This was hard medicine for a wife to take, but before long she discovered that by cooperating with him, he was quite willing to modify his habits for her.

Another hang-up common to Martha Melancholy is jealousy. Not given to “insincere flirtation,” she often marries a man who is outgoing and friendly to all. It is not uncommon for her to ride home in icy silence after a party because her husband “flirted with every woman there.” Since her husband’s male ego gets so little food at home, he unwisely seeks it at social gatherings. And he may often think, “Nothing I do ever satisfies that woman!”

Seated across from the beautiful wife of a wealthy and dynamic Christian businessman, I was startled to hear his melancholy wife ask me, “Would you explain why I am so jealous of my husband even when I know I have no reason for it?” It seems that he had dismissed three successive secretaries and finally hired the homeliest gal he could find just because of his wife’s jealousy, but it still didn’t solve her problem. I responded, “The problem is not with your husband; you just don’t like yourself.” Tears ran down her cheeks as she admitted to strong feelings of self-rejection. Later her husband commented concerning their love life, “When her groundless suspicions make her jealous, I can’t touch her. But when she is sorry for her accusations, she can’t get enough of me. I never know whether to expect feast or famine!”

Martha’s biggest problem in life will be the tendency toward self-pity. A melancholy can follow the slightest insult or rejection with self-pitying thoughts that plunge her into a state of depression until she is not interested in love or anything else.

The emotional capability of a melancholy is so extensive that she has the potential of being an exciting and fulfilling love partner if her weaknesses don’t overpower her strengths. Here are some of her specific needs:

(1) A vital and effective relationship with Jesus Christ, walking in his Spirit, so that she may enjoy the love, peace, and joy he gives to make her an effective person.
(2) A thankful attitude for all the blessings God has given her, never thinking or verbalizing criticism for the things that don’t please her. She will discover that a positive mental attitude combined with thanksgiving can give her a happier outlook on life and make her a more pleasant person for others to enjoy. This attitude will also help her to accept herself as she is; self-condemnation will destroy her. It is very difficult for others to like her if she does not like herself.
(3) Acceptance of her husband as he is, permitting God to make any changes that are needed. Her submission to him should not be dependent on his behavior, but on her obedience to God.
(4) Encouragement and reassurances of love from her husband. A thoughtful and verbally expressive husband who proves his love in many other areas of their marriage will be rewarded in this one.
(5) The request that God give her an unconditional love for her husband and the ability to love him to the point that she forgets about herself. She needs to realize that married love is beautiful because it is God’s plan for married partners. Our Lord promises that a woman who gives herself without reservations to her husband will be loved. He said, “Give and it shall be given unto you,” and “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” If a woman sows love, she will surely reap it in abundance.
(6) The lesson of forgiveness. Almost every durable marriage requires forgiveness along the way. Because an unforgiving attitude will always destroy a relationship, the partners must realize that their harmony requires it and God commands it (Matt. 18:35; Mark 11:25).

### THE PHLEGMATIC HUSBAND’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Not much is known about the bedroom life of Phil Phlegmatic. He is without doubt the world’s most closed-mouth individual, particularly concerning his personal life. What is known about this intimate area usually comes from an irate partner, consequently, the information could well be biased. In fairness to the phlegmatic male, therefore, any suggestions we make concerning his lovemaking responses have to be evaluated on the basis of deductive analysis and hearsay reporting. His secondary temperament will also have a powerful influence on his expression, as will his background and mental attitude.

Some assume that because a phlegmatic is easygoing and prone to be unmotivated, he may not be a very spirited lover, but that may not always be true. If a study of the habits of phlegmatics is indicative, we find that they usually accomplish more than they are given credit for. They just don’t make noise and attract much attention to their achievements like other temperaments. Rather, they make good use of the effort expended. When they want to do something, they follow through effectively and promptly in their own quiet way. We suspect that is the way they make love.

One characteristic of phlegmatics should help their love life: their abundant kindness. Rarely, if ever, would Phil Phlegmatic embarrass or insult his wife; sarcasm is just not his way. Women usually respond to a man who is kind to them. On that basis he should have little trouble gaining love from his wife, if he desires it.

Another trait that is surely a great advantage is that a phlegmatic rarely gets angry and seldom creates irritation in others. If his fiery partner screams at him for some reason, his response usually extinguishes the fire because he is a master of the “soft answer.” Consequently, the storm has usually passed by bedtime, and he can conveniently act as if it never happened.

Phlegmatic men often have a way of getting things to go their way by waiting for them. They are patience personified, apparently able to out-wait others into action. Their love life is probably like that. As the intensity of their youthful sex drive cools down somewhat they patiently teach their partner to originate lovemaking. And it may be that phlegmatics may get used to a less frequent than average lovemaking schedule as their drive cools. This could be habit. Sexual frequency in marriage is often related to habit. Those who perform three times a week for twenty years may continue that pattern for another twenty years, while those who perform once a week may be satisfied with that schedule. The phlegmatic is the most likely to be satisfied with the least frequent schedule.

The phlegmatic’s needs are few, but they are important.

(1) To walk in the Spirit, which will make him more expressive and aggressive in his love for his wife. Phlegmatics are often selfish, but the Spirit of God can make them loving and thoughtful.
(2) To learn to verbalize love. Phlegmatics often feel love but fail to communicate it. This is a serious mistake, for a woman needs to hear her husband’s love verbalized. A wife who knows her husband loves her will be much more responsive to his advances than one who is uncertain of his affections.
(3) To be married to a woman who understands his temperament and is not easily offended by his lack of aggressiveness. Many a phlegmatic has been prodded into more frequent lovemaking by an understanding wife who knows how to motivate him.

### THE PHLEGMATIC WIFE’S SEXUAL RESPONSES

Phyllis Phlegmatic is a very pleasant, peaceful, and easygoing individual. She is usually a good housekeeper, a fine mother, and a wonderful cook. Her quiet, gracious manner makes her an enjoyable companion, and she is not easily offended. She is the kind of woman who will quietly listen to her husband’s problems without criticizing him or offering unwanted advice. These are great assets in any woman.

In lovemaking, Phyllis is tender, kind, and thoughtful. She is not usually aggressive, but she is not passive either. She is responsive. She will usually adapt to her husband’s needs and desires, and if he is thoughtful and considerate, she will find lovemaking very enjoyable. If he is selfish and demanding, she will endure it, but without much enthusiasm. Her greatest enjoyment comes from the tenderness, thoughtfulness, and love expressed by her husband. She will not usually complain about her husband’s lack of attention, but she will be deeply hurt by it.

Phyllis’s greatest need is to be married to a man who is thoughtful and considerate. If her husband is a choleric, he may be too demanding and critical. If he is a sanguine, he may be too flirtatious and undisciplined. If he is a melancholy, he may be too critical and moody. But if he is a phlegmatic, they may have a very peaceful but unexciting love life. The ideal husband for Phyllis is a man who is loving, thoughtful, and considerate, and who verbalizes his love for her.

Phyllis’s needs are simple:

(1) To walk in the Spirit, which will make her more expressive and responsive to her husband’s needs.
(2) To learn to verbalize her love and appreciation for her husband. Phlegmatics often feel love but fail to communicate it. This is a serious mistake, for a man needs to hear his wife’s love verbalized.
(3) To be married to a man who understands her temperament and is not easily offended by her lack of aggressiveness. Many a phlegmatic wife has been prodded into more frequent lovemaking by an understanding husband who knows how to motivate her.

### SUMMARY

Sexual harmony in marriage is not automatic. It requires understanding, patience, and a willingness to adapt to your partner’s needs. The more you understand your own temperament and your partner’s, the easier it will be to achieve a satisfying sexual relationship. Remember, God designed sex for our enjoyment and for the strengthening of the marriage bond. With his help, you can experience the joy and fulfillment he intended.
