🧠 What SELVE Is

SELVE is a psychological profiling and self-awareness platform designed to help users understand who they are — their personality, behavior, emotions, and motivations — through a mix of scientific psychology and AI-driven analysis.

It’s essentially a personal mirror powered by AI: a place where people can discover how they think, feel, and act — and how to grow from it.

🎯 Core Purpose

To help individuals see themselves clearly — their strengths, weaknesses, emotional tendencies, and hidden patterns — and to use that understanding to improve:

Relationships

Decision-making

Communication

Mental well-being

Personal and professional growth

⚙️ How It Works

SELVE gathers data in three main ways:

User Self-Input
Users answer deep, structured questions about thoughts, emotions, habits, and reactions.

Third-Party Perspective (unique feature)
Users can invite trusted people (friends, partners, colleagues) to take a test about them — offering an outside view for higher accuracy.

AI Behavioral Analysis (future feature)
SELVE will analyze communication style, writing patterns, or social behavior to detect traits and emotional states automatically.

💡 Outputs

After data analysis, SELVE produces:

A comprehensive personality report

Trait visualizations and breakdowns (based on a custom system inspired by Big Five, MBTI, DISC, and Tim LaHaye)

Personalized advice, reflection prompts, and growth recommendations

Optional AI-guided coaching for self-improvement

🔍 The SELVE Typing System

Instead of copying MBTI types (like INFP or ENTJ), SELVE uses its own naming and symbolism, possibly inspired by animals or archetypes — for example:

The Lion → brave and assertive

The Owl → thoughtful and analytical

The Dove → calm and empathetic

This makes the system more relatable, visual, and unique.
