Alright so you got this file (src/app/(wizard)/assessment/wizard/page.tsx). , if some components needs creating, create it. if components are missing, create it. YOUR SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE BEST PRACTICE, INDUSTRY-STANDARD, PROFESSIONAL, ERROR-FREE & ROBUST, DRY code, and Scalable and Reusable.

Also read questionnaire.md and see where this thing is leading to, what we plan on doing or intend doing, it's a rough sketch though. Whatever best practices and industry standard idea you might have, don't hesistate to ask me. The backend will be sending the questions to the frontend. so there needs to be a way in communication (likely from the backend) in which how the messages (questions in the sense) needs to be displayed or rendered. You'd be designing the wizard from the given figma design. so take for example in this figma desgin https://www.figma.com/design/NNiQGPrdaERSRgaAwBdI7P/Untitled?node-id=17-368&t=u5kKLuB0QJcsrNl1-4 and this https://www.figma.com/design/NNiQGPrdaERSRgaAwBdI7P/Untitled?node-id=17-4270&t=u5kKLuB0QJcsrNl1-4 (this is for mobile, you'll notice that the image at the left is no more, so when it's around tablet size, remove the image and remain the form for responsiveness) you'll notice that pill shape options were used for questions that requires pill shape or capsule-like shape. so the backend will be sending the question and how it wants it rendered, so the frontend obeys the instruction chooses from it's list of "tools". If the backend wants to send something like input or so, like this example https://www.figma.com/design/zWfcQEGsWmoH1bVnXivM9D/Untitled?node-id=2-449&t=8Rw94BoZrqQy9VEB-4 then the message should be relayed to the frontend how the content should be rendered. if it's a text box, if it'll be needing like adatefield, same. multiple of these classes can be on a phase of screen (like section of question) so beware, so i guess per question should have what and how it's gonna be rendered.


There should be checkpoints, just like this one https://www.figma.com/design/6qK3RXz3YuWn7l86sMyUZw/Checkpoints?node-id=5-3&t=DlzVWsgth0OsD0O4-4


You'll observe from the figma designs that there's some sort of Artistic Canvas designed at the left of the screen while we have the survey at the right, that can be used too maybe be in its own component all by itself for scalability. my plans initially were to be switching the designs every random couple of minutes. you can switch with different designs and subtle artisic colors (or animately colors) + some already-prepared images in public\images\artistico\. so interchangeably. The image or design at the left should be 100% vh, that means it not scrollable, it is only the right side, the form that will be scrollable if the content is longer than viewport. For responsiveness, the image should disappear leaving only the form, for smaller and mobile screen as you'd notice in the figma designs. but for tablet and larger screens should the image and form stand side by side. if you're loading image or let's say the user is visting or opens the website, I guess a random canvas design, Artistic Canvas not image should show always show first then later on goes on to image. Why? because i fear the image might take to long to load. Also if there be the case where the image is failing to load, a design (artistic canvas) should be a backup until the image is ready to render.

If there's anything you want to clarify before starting the task, let me know and I'll try my best to answer. We want to get this right.

Try and observe the repository, understand it from head to toe 100%, we dont have a seperate backend yet, and we plan on having one later, but your implementation should be one that will take care of this. If you feel there's need to create a backend so that we be safe, then you can create a folder in the root and call it "backend" then safely move everything else to a new folder you'd create called "frontend". Make sure you explore the repository, it's traditions and how code is written, check to see if things are already done, like functions or components that has been written before that you may need so that you don't try to reinvent the wheel, and cause duplicate, this is to be sure we want to be DRY, prevent code cluttering, simple and understandable code. YOu'll be writing your code in the wizard folder, you can create your custom components in best practices place, anywhere you feel is right. We use Sentry and Neon, PostHog, just to keep you posted, that's why i said check the repo to see.

If there be anything that you want to ask, maybe for clarity and full understanding, don't hesitate to ask me (after you've read the task and gone through the repo) and I'll try my best to answer, otherwise proceed with the task.


BEST-PRACTICES, PROFESSIONALISM, DRYness, INDUSTRY-STANDARD CODE, ERROR-FREE & ROBUST

also try not change my code, or stuffs, outside the scope of the task.
